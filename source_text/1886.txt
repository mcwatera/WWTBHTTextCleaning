<p><strong>WHITMAN FOR THE DRAWING ROOM.</strong></p><p>MR. RHYS and his publisher surely meant well when they decided to issue a volume of selections from Leaves of Grass.∗ The book is not intended for the confirmed admirers of Whitman, for they will be satisfied with nothing less than the complete work, and it can be of small benefit to his opponents. These opponents may be divided into two classes: persons who honestly object to Whitman's plainness of speech, because they regard it as unnecessary and unfitting. They say there is a time to be silent, and though no part or function of man if properly treated is disgraceful, there is no reason why all should be publicly exhibited. Whitman, they say, has erred in judgment. These persons we can respect; their opinion is honest and intelligible. The other class we cannot respect. It consists for the most part of hack writers to the press who think it no portion of their duty to know anything of the works they are paid to review† and of the patrons of these scribes, the retailers of literary small-talk in British drawing-rooms, whose god is Mrs. Grundy, and whose sole virtue is to appear respectable. No doubt a good many of these will buy the Selections, Whitman's reputation among them having, hitherto, been questionable; just as an actress of easy virtue draws them to the theatre, though her histronic powers are nowhere and her manners on the stage the pink of propriety.</p><p>These persons will certainly be disappointed, not only with the selections which Mr. Rhys has prepared, but with the original and complete volume itself. They will not find in either what they want. The speech is plain and unveiled, but cleanly. Veiled obscenity in the shape of a joke, a spicy story, or the reports of criminal cases in the Pall Mall Gazette are more to their minds. The second-hand bookseller knows their taste well, and when he labels a volume 'curious' adds fifty per cent. to the price. There are even certain fellows of the baser sort whose trade consists in lending out willfully obscene books to these 'respectable' people for their private reading.</p><p>Their private reading, to be sure! for in public nothing—unless it be the Pall Mall's leading articles—could exceed the solemn piety and hatred of everything gross which they exhibit. Nothing that would bring 'the blush to the maiden cheek' can be tolerated by them. They are above all else zealous for the virtue of their womankind, just as if they had never laughed over the story of a treacherous seduction, or participated in one themselves. Not, indeed, that they object to being described as 'knowing dogs' or 'men about town,' for this rather enhances their reputation among some of their fair friends. The British matrons are eager enough to give their daughters in marriage to them, regardless of the prior claim which some other young woman may have, but which she cannot enforce because it has not received a priestly blessing; nor are the maidens themselves touched with remorse or with sympathy when they usurp the place. Mrs. Grundy does not require it so to act as they do is respectable, and there is nothing more to be said or done.</p><p>Yet even respectable people need relaxation sometimes, and to test their private morality you must ascertain why the gentlemen guffau over their wine, and the ladies in the drawing-room—before the gentlemen arrive—titter hysterically behind their handkerchiefs. Mrs. Josephine Butler, many years ago, stated publicly that she had given up dinner-parties because she could not endure the after-dinner talk of the drawing-rooms.</p><p>These are the people who most vigorously condemn as immoral the plain spoken, cleanly minded Whitman, and while, as we have said, they will very likely buy Mr. Rhys' book, there is no hope that it will benefit them. Possibly, however, a copy here and there will fall into the hands of some man or woman who, thus becoming acquainted with the 'good grey poet' for the first time, will make good use of the opportunity. To many Whitman has, hitherto, been only a name; to some not even that. Perhaps the little volume has a mission to them.</p><p>Coming now to the book itself we find something to condemn and something, also, to praise. The portrait is no better than a caricature. The Introductory Notice is interesting, but it would have been more satisfactory had its author kept clear of ungraceful affectation in style. 'Depicture' and 'invigorative' are not elegant, and 'most immediate' is something worse. However, in these cases we are able to gather what the writer means; but occasionally it is impossible. What, for example does he mean by this: 'Born on Long Island or Paumanok, its Indian name, by which he always calls it, in the State of New York, of a stalwart race of farmers, in 1819, the freedom of sun and wind was his, in a wide country side, with rising hills around, and the sea that he has sung so affectionately, with such deep sympathy, so that is harmonies seem to have subtly informed his poetry, close by.' In short, if we may presume to give a word of advice to Mr. Rhys it will be—avoid, as you would poison, the mannerisms—not to say vulgarisms of the so-called æsthetic school. The best written passages are those which, obviously, are in the author's natural style. Mr. Rhys is a hearty yet discriminating admirer of Whitman. His reference to Burns is very happy, and there is much justice in his remark that the advance Whitman has made 'is a great one, beyond a doubt. The only danger is that in accepting this new tendency we may neglect the great virtues of past modes. Always the salvation of all art expression lies in the perfect adjustment of the new with the old.' Mr. Rhys does not note the real advance with, as it seems to us, Whitman had made beyond his predecessors, namely in his sentiment toward death. Others have treated death as a 'dread monster,' an enemy, or have simply ignored it. Even Goethe said 'Death is something so strange that, notwithstanding all experience, one thinks it impossible for it to seize a beloved object; and it always presents itself as something incredible and unexpected.' Whitman alone hails it lovingly, as a friend:</p><p>'Come, lovely and soothing death,<br>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving<br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>Sooner or later delicate death.</p><p>'Prais'd be the fathomless universe,<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,<br>And for love, sweet love—but praise! praise! praise!<br>For the sure enwinding arms of cool, enfolding death.</p><p>'Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.'</p><p>'The method of selection adopted in preparing the volume,' remarks Mr. Rhys modestly, 'has certainly not been scientific or very profoundly critical.' The task of selection in the case of Whitman would undoubtedly have peculiar difficulties. 'The limitations of the average run of readers have been, as far as could be surmised, the limitations of the book.' All things considered, Mr. Rhys has chosen well, but that the Song of Myself, containing as it does some of Whitman's finest as well as his most characteristic work, should have been wholly omitted, is singular. It is here he gives his key-note:</p><p>'I celebrate myself and sing myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.'</p><p>Here, also, occur such grand passages as the following:</p><p>'Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument<br> of the earth<br>And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own<br>And I know that the Spirit of God is the brother of my own<br>And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers<br>And that a kelson of the creation is love.'<br>. . . . . . .<br>'Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?<br>I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.'</p><p>'Vivas to those who have fail'd!<br>And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!<br>And to those themselves who sank in the sea!<br>And to all generals that lost engagements and all overcome heroes!<br>And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!'</p><p>Another omission which we can hardly approve is The Singer in Prison, but after all, something had to be omitted, and the editor's task was by no means an easy one. He has not omitted, as some editors might have done, In a City Dead House and The Flight of the Eagles. The former touches on a subject treated by Hood in his Bridge of Sighs, but grandly not morbidly. The latter is as artistic as anything Whitman has written. Mr. Rhys and Mr. Scott deserve credit for this effort to popularize Leaves of Grass. When may we hope to see a complete edition at a shilling?</p><p>———</p><p>∗ The Poems of Walt Whitman (Selected), with Introduction by ERNEST RHYS. Walter Scott, I/-.</p><p>†For instance, here is a Saturday Reviewer, boldly denouncing Whitman, who does not even know the name of Whitman's book. Blades of Grass, he calls it.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S POETRY.</strong></p><p>What a whirl of 'new editions' we are in! Perhaps we must not complain—especially in those cases where the new edition is brought, by its price, within the reach of millions, instead of only thousands—if, when we turn them over, we find most disappointing omissions. Here is a new edition of the 'Poems of Walt Whitman' (published by Chatto and Windus), selected and edited by William Michael Rossetti. It is of convenient bulk, and excellent in paper and type and binding; and we must be thankful, even though there be nothing added to it from the volumes Walt Whitman has published since 1868. Mr. Rossetti is a most loyal and charitable interpreter of this most unmelodious and unrhythmical of poets; this strong, self-assured man, who 'entertains and professes respecting himself the grave conviction that he is the actual and prospective founder of a new poetic literature and a great one—a literature proportioned to the material vastness and the unmeasured destinies of America; he believes that the Columbus of the Continent, or the Washington of the States, was not more truly than himself in the future a founder and upbuilder of this America. Surely a sublime conviction, and expressed more than once in magnificent words—none more so than in the following poem'— 'Love of Comrades':—</p><p>Come, I will make the continent indissoluble;<br>I will make the most splendid race the sun ever yet <br>shone upon!<br>I will make divine magnetic lands,<br>With the love of comrades,<br>With the life-long love of comrades.<br>I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the<br> rivers of America, and along the shores of the great <br>lakes, and all over the prairies;<br>I will make inseparable cities, with their arms about each <br>other’s necks;<br>By the love of comrades,<br>By the manly love of comrades.<br>For you these, from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma <br>femme!<br>For you! for you, I am trilling these songs,<br>In the love of comrades,<br>In the high-towering love of comrades.</p><p>Mr. Rossetti believes that this idea of himself 'is true, if not absolutely, yet with a most genuine and substantial approximation.' He believes that Whitman 'is one of the huge, as yet mainly unrecognized, forces of our time; privileged to evoke, in a country hitherto still asking for its poet, a fresh, athletic, and American poetry, and predestined to be traced up to by generation after generation of believing and ardent—let us hope not servile—disciples. 'Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.' Shelley, who knew what he was talking about when poetry was the subject, has said it, and with a profundity of truth. Whitman seems in a peculiar degree marked out for 'legislation' of the kind referred to. His voice will one day be potential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken—that is to say, in the four corners of the earth; and in his own American hemisphere, the uttermost avatars of democracy will confess him not more their announcer than their inspirer.'</p><p>Great is Walt Whitman, therefore, and W. M. Rossetti is his prophet. All the prophet says about his master may be well judged and true. We are glad we have no need to say it is or it is not. What we do say is that much beauty and much strength are in these poems; but the beauty is often very far to seek, and the strength is often provokingly tedious in its self-manifestations, and we heartily echo the hope of Mr. Rossetti that Whitman's 'disciples' in the future will not be 'servile.' The only poem—assuredly a beautiful one—in the whole collection which can be called rhythmical (and there are in it also some rhymes) is the one 'For the Death of Lincoln':</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done.<br>The ship has weathered every wrack, the prize we sought<br>is won;<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and<br>daring;<br>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>Leave you not the little spot<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.<br>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells!<br>Rise up! for you the flag is flung, for you the bugle trills:<br>For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths, for you the shores<br>a-crowding:<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces <br>turning.<br>O Captain! dear father!<br>This arm I push beneath you.<br>It is some dream that on the dock<br>You've fallen cold and dead!<br>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still:<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will.<br>But the ship, the ship is anchored safe, its voyage closed<br>and done:<br>From fearful trip the victorship comes in with object won!<br>Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!<br>But I, with silent trade,<br>Walk the spot my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>In this and in 'President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn' Whitman is really at his best as a poet; and in some of the 'Drum Taps,' which are the outcome of his brotherly and tender devotion to the wounded soldiers of the North during the great war, the pathos that breathes up through the great jagged lines and sentences is an almost startling revelation of the warmth and depth of his nature. We are not sure that the prose 'Preface to Leaves of Grass' is not greater than anything else he has written. It deserves to be read, and it can be read more easily than many of the poems.</p>
