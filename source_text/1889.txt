<p><strong>WHITMAN'S COMPLETE WORKS</strong></p><p>———</p><p><strong>A Fine 'Personally Handled' Edition of the Poet,</strong></p><p>———</p><p><strong>With Autograph—A Volume That Book Lovers Will Prize—Some of Its Notable Features—New Poems and Prose—Whitman's Estimate of His Own Career—Opinion of Tennyson.</strong></p><p>The complete edition of Walt Whitman's works, just issued by the poet himself in one volume, is a book to be prized by the bibliophile as well as treasured by Whitman's friends. The plates of the three uniform volumes comprising Whitman's writings are used, but with the broad margins and finer paper of the uncut sheets, the guise seems an entirely new one. The text has received a final revision, there is the charm of certain additions, there are several portraits of Whitman ranging from his early prime to one taken in his 70th year, and there is the great value of the direct association of the poet's personality, as guaranteed in the words of the handsome title page, with its fine profile reproduced from a photograph: Complete Poems and Prose of Walt Whitman. 1855-1888. Authenticated and Personal Book (Handled by W. W.) Portraits from Life. Autograph. On the first fly leaf of the copy before the writer are the words, written in the poet's familiar hand: 'S——B ——, from his friend, the author, Walt Whitman, with affection and memories.—Dec. 21, 1888.' The handwriting is strikingly firm and bold, showing that the paralysis that afflicts the author has not affected his firm hand.</p><p>The cover is a plain one, with marbled sides and back of dark olive, with the title pasted on in plain white paper: Walt Whitman, Complete Poems and Prose—Leaves of Grass, Specimen Days and Collect, November Boughs with Sands at Seventy, Annex to L. of G.—Portraits from Life, and Autograph Ed'n 1888-9. Altogether, the volume combines the homely democratic simplicity associated with Whitman's name with the essential features of a handsome book—a worthy garment for the great thoughts presented. The note at the end, written for this edition on Nov. 13, 1888, states the author's motives for publishing it, and may be called</p><p><strong>His Literary Valedictory.</strong></p><p>'As I conclude—and (to get typographical correctness,) after running my eyes diligently through the three big divisions of the preceding volume—the interrogative wonder-fancy rises in me whether (if it be not too arrogant to even state it), the 33 years of my current time, 1855-1888, with their aggregate of our new world doings and people, have not, indeed, created and formulated the foregoing leaves—forcing their utterance as the pages stand—coming actually from the direct urge and developments of those years, and not from any individual epic or lyrical attempts whatever, or from my pen or voice, or any body's special voice. Out of that supposition the book might be considered an autochthonic record, and expression, fully rendered, of and out of these 30 to 35 years—of the soul and evolution of America—and, of course, by reflection, not ours only, but more or less of the common people of the world. Seems to me I may dare to claim a deep native tap root for the book, too, in some sort. I came on the stage too late for personally knowing much of even the lingering revolutionary worthies—the men of '76. Yet, as a little boy, I have been pressed tightly and lovingly to the breast of Lafayette (Brooklyn, 1825), and have talked with old Aaron Burr, and also with those who knew Washington and his surroundings, and with original Jeffersonians, and more than one very old soldier and sailor. And in my own day and maturity, my eyes have seen and ears heard, Lincoln, Grant and Emerson, and my hands have been grasped by their hands. Though in a different field and range from most of theirs, I give the foregoing pages as perfectly legitimate, resultant, evolutionary and consistent with them. If these lines should ever reach some reader of a far-off future age, let him take them as a missive sent from Abraham Lincoln's fateful age. Repeating, parrot-like, what in the preceding divisions has been already said, and must serve as a great reason why of this whole book—first, that the main part about pronounced events and shows (poems and persons, also) is the point of view from which they are viewed and estimated: and second, that I cannot let my momentous, stormy, peculiar era of peace and war, these states, these years, slip away without arresting some of its specimen events—even its vital breaths—to be portrayed and inscribed from out of the midst of it, from its own days and nights—not so much in themselves (statistically and descriptively our times are copiously noted and memorandized with an industrial zeal), but to give from them here their flame-like results in imaginative and spiritual suggestiveness, as they present themselves to me, at any rate, from the point of view alluded to.</p><p>'Then a few additional words yet to this hurried farewell note. In another sense (the warp crossing the woof and knitted in) the book is probably a sort of autobiography, an element I have not attempted especially to restrain or erase. As alluded to at the beginning, I had about got the volume well started by the printers, when a sixth recurrent attack of my war paralysis fell upon me. It has proved the most serious and continued of the whole. I am now uttering</p><p><strong>''November Boughs'</strong></p><p>and printing this book in my 70th year. To get out the collection—mainly the born results of health, flush life, buoyancy and happy outdoor volition—and to prepare the Boughs have beguiled my invalid months the past summer and fall. ('Are we to be beaten down in our old age?' says one white-haired old fellow remonstratingly to another in a budget of letters I read last night.) ∗∗∗ Then I wanted to leave something markedly personal. I have put my name with pen and ink with my own hand in the present volume. And from engraved or photographed portraits, taken from life, I have selected some, of different stages, which please me best, (or at any rate displease me least), and bequeath them at a venture to you, reader, with my love. W. W., Nov. 13, 1888.'</p><p>'Leaves of Grass' has the following prefatory verses in this volume:</p><p>'Come, said my soul,<br>Such verses for my body let us write (for we <br>are one),<br>That should I after death invisibly return,<br>Or, long, long hence, in other spheres,<br>There to some group of mates the chants re-<br>suming,<br>(Tallying earth's soil, trees, winds, tumultu-<br>ous waves.)<br>Ever with pleased smile I may keep on.<br>Ever and ever yet the verses owning—as, <br>first, I here and now,<br>Signing for soul and body, set to them my<br> name,</p><p>WALT WHITMAN.'</p><p>The second book, 'Specimen Days and Collect,' contains two things which alone would make it invaluable, the preface to the first issue of 'Leaves of Grass,' that of 1855, and the great essay, 'Democratic Vistas.' Since Whitman included verse only in the final form of 'Leaves of Grass' the original preface is given in the prose book. It is known as a masterpiece of composition in the grand style. Its thoughts borne free on the wings of a spontaneous rhythm. Many of its passages will be recognized as having been worked over into later poems. 'Democratic Vistas' is one of the greatest essays ever written concerning America. Whitman speaks here as a seer. Probably no one has ever taken a more comprehensive, far-seeing national view. It is a paper for statesmen in the highest sense. With his healthy, strong, optimistic mind, he looks far ahead through the centuries and perceives the grand destiny of our country, but this does not make him ignore the shadows of the picture, and the very clearness of his prophetic vision shows to him, also, the plainer the perils that beset the road to the goal, as in these words of warning: 'Shift and turn the combinations of the statement as we may, the problem of the future of America is, in certain respects, as dark as it is vast. Pride, competition, segregation, vicious willfulness, and license beyond example, brood already upon us. Unwieldy and immense, who shall hold in behemoth, who bridle leviathan? Flaunt it as we choose, athwart and over the roads of our progress loom huge uncertainty, and dreadful, threatening gloom. It is useless to deny it: Democracy grows rankly up the thickest, noxious, deadliest plants and fruits of all—brings worse and worse invaders—needs newer, larger, stronger, keener compensations and compellers.'</p><p><strong>A Review from the Close.</strong></p><p>'November Boughs' begins with a review of the poet's career, and works from the standpoint of the journey's close: 'A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads.' There is humility and modesty in its tone, as well as hopefulness, assertion and a brave, serene confidence. Characterizing his poems, he thus prescribes his purpose and his method:</p><p>The word I myself put primarily for the description of them as they stand at last is the word suggestiveness. I round and finish little, if anything, and could not consistently with my scheme. The reader will always have his or her part to do, just as much as I have had mine. I seek less to state or display any theme or thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the theme or thought, there to pursue your own flight. Another impetus word is comradeship as for all lands, and in a more commanding and acknowledged sense than hitherto. Other word signs would be good cheer, content and hope. The chief trait of any given poet is always the spirit he brings to the observation of humanity and nature, the mood out of which he contemplates his subjects. [illegible] Universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities or individuals at all times, there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their normal recognizance. Literature is always calling in the doctor for consultation and confession, and always giving evasions and swathing suppressions in place of that 'heroic nudity' on which only a genuine diagnosis of serious cases can be built. And in respect to editors of Leaves of Grass in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion now to confirm these lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of 30 years, and to hereby prohibit, as far as word of mine can do so, any elision of them.</p><p>He continued with the following reverent words:</p><p>Then still a purpose inclosing all, and over and beneath all. Ever since what might be called thought, or the budding of thought, fairly began in my youthful mind, I had had a desire to attempt some worthy record of that entire faith and acceptance ('to justify the ways of God to man' is Milton's well known and ambitious phrase) which is the foundation of moral America. I felt it all as positively then in my young days as I do now in my old ones: to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should directly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom, health, mystery, beauty of every process, every concrete object, every human or other existence, not only considered from the point of view of all, but of each. While I cannot understand it or argue it out, I fully believe in a clew and purpose in nature, entire and several; and that invisible spiritual results, just as real and definite as the visible, eventuate all concrete life and all materialism, through time. My book ought to emanate buoyance and gladness legitimately enough, for it was grown out of those elements, and has been the comfort of my life since it was originally commenced.</p><p>He ends with the words:</p><p>In the free evening of my day, I give to you, reader, the foregoing garrulous talk, thoughts, reminiscences,</p><p>As idly drifting down the ebb,<br>Such ripples, half-caught voices echo from the shore.</p><p>Concluding with two items for the imaginative genius of the West when it worthily rises—First, what Herder taught to the young Goethe, that really great poetry is always (like the Homeric or Biblical canticles) the result of a national spirit, and not the privilege of a polished and select few. Second, that the strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung.</p><p><strong>The Latest Poems</strong></p><p>The latest poems, given under the title of 'Sands at Seventy' are like the voice of an old friend whose tones we have learned to love for the sake of the words they have conveyed, the thoughts they have clothed. So ever after, whatever the words be, the tones have a welcome sound. It is so with all old poets; their message has been spoken, their great harvest has been gathered, but the aftermath is to be valued, and scant though it may be, it still contains the quality, the savor of the rich soil that has rejoiced us with its abundant yield. These latest poems of Whitman's are fragmentary utterances; they have the old character of form and expression, but are intermittent flashes; detached images, brief glimpses. As with Dr. Holmes, these songs are pervaded by the reminiscent atmosphere of sunset hours. In one of the traits that have strongly characterized Whitman there is no perceptible decline—that of graphic, terse and vivid delineation with a word or phrase that both depicts and suggests, like the sure brush stroke of a master painter. An example of this is to be found in the stately beginning on the poem of the death of Gen. Grant: 'As one by one withdraw the mighty actors,' striking at once the keynote of a majestic theme that is sustained with the same power to the close:</p><p>Thou from the prairies!—tangled and many- <br>veined and hard has been thy part,<br>To admiration has it been enacted?</p><p>It is a glorious calm that pervades these four lines:</p><p>After the dazzle of day is gone,<br>Only the dark, dark night shows to my eyes the stars;<br>After the clangor of organ majestic, or chorus, <br>or perfect band,<br>Silent, athwart my soul, moves the symphony <br>true.</p><p>And, in these lines called 'Halcyon Days' the re [sic] is manifest what was once said of Appollonius of Tyana, that old age, as well as youth, has its bloom:</p><p>Not from successful love alone,<br>Nor wealth, nor honored middle age, nor vic-<br>tories of politics or war,<br>But as life wanes and all the turbulent pas-<br>sions calm,<br>As gorgeous, vapory, silent hues cover the <br>evening sky,<br>As softness, fullness, rest, suffuse the frame, <br>like fresher, balmier air,<br>As the days take on a mellower light, and the <br>apple at last hangs really finish'd and in-<br>dolent ripe on the tree,<br>Then for the teeming quietest, happiest days <br>of all!<br>The brooding and blissful halcyon days!</p><p>A strong group of poems are the 'Fancies at Navesink;' reflections on the meanings of the ocean rides as the pulse of the power that vivifies all—the 'fluid, vast identity, holding the universe with all its parts as one.' Then the ebb, with its images of death, failure and despair swept on to oblivion—but that not the end, for</p><p>Duly by you, from you, the tide and the <br>light again—duly the hinges turning.<br>Duly the needed discord parts offsetting, <br>blending,<br>Weaving from you, from Sleep, Night, Death <br>itself.<br>The rhythms of birth eternal.</p><p>The six-line poem on Whittier's 80th birthday is a beautiful tribute. Those fond of drawing analogies might find much satisfaction in the resemblance in the names of the two poets, one a Hicksite Quaker, the other the son of Hicksite Quakers. Whitman passing his last years across the river from the great Quaker City, always using the quaint Quaker terminology of 'Fifth Month,' etc., and devoting the last pages of his 'November Boughs' to a collection of notes on Elias Hicks, of whom he says in his prefatory note:</p><p>As myself a little boy hearing so much of E. H., at that time long ago in Suffolk and Queens and Kings counties—and more than once personally seeing the old man—and my dear, dear father and mother faithful listeners to him at the meetings—I remember how I dreamed to write, perhaps, a piece about E. H. and his look and discourses however long afterward—for my parents' sake—and the dear Friends, too! And the following is what has at last but all come out of it—the feeling and intention never forgotten yet!</p><p><strong>Whitman's opinion of Tennyson</strong></p><p>is of particular interest, since the British laureate is one of our great American's most intimate, though never beheld, friends across the Atlantic. In the brief paper, 'A Word About Tennyson,' Whitman says:</p><p>Let me assume to pass verdict, or, perhaps, momentary judgment, for the United States on this poet—a removed and distant position giving some advantages over a nigh one. What is Tennyson's service to his race, times, and especially to America? First, I should say—or, at least, not forget—his personal character. He is not to be mentioned as a rugged, evolutionary, aboriginal force—but (and a great lesson is in it) he has been consistent throughout with the native, healthy patriotic spinal element and promptings of himself. His moral line is local and conventional, but it is vital and genuine. He reflects the upper crust of his time, its pale cast of thought—even its ennui. Then the simile of my friend, John Burroughs, is entirely true. 'His glove is a glove of silk, but the hand is a hand of iron.' He shows how one can be a royal laureate, quite eloquent and 'aristocratic,' and a little queer and affected, and at the same time perfectly manly and natural. As to his non-democracy, it fits him well, and I like him the better for it. I guess we all like to have (I am sure I do) some one who presents those sides of a thought or a possibility, different from our own—different, and yet with a sort of home-likeness—a tartness and contradiction offsetting the theory as we view it, and construed from taste and proclivities not at all his own…Yes, Alfred Tennyson is a superb character, and will help give illustriousness, through the long roll of time, to our 19th century. In its bunch of orbic names, shining like a constellation of stars, his will be one of the brightest. His very faults, doubts, swervings, doublings upon himself, have been typical of our age. We are like the voyagers of a ship casting off for new seas, distant shores. We would still dwell in the old suffocating and dead haunts, remembering and magnifying their pleasant experiences only, and more than once impelled to jump ashore before it is too late, and stay where our fathers stayed and live as they lived. May-be I am non-literary and non-decorous (let me at least be human and pay part of my debt) in this word about Tennyson. I want him to realize that here is a great and ardent nation that absorbs his songs, and has a respect and affection for him personally as almost for no other foreigner. I want this word to go to the old man at Farringford as conveying no more than the simple truth: and that truth (a little Christmas gift) no slight one, either.</p><p>There are many other words worth reading in this new section of the volume; papers on Shakespeare, Robert Burns, Fr. Taylor, remarks on 'The Spanish Element in Our Nationality,' and various random notes and reminiscences, including some additional ones about the war. It is all pervaded by the healthy personal feeling, lofty patriotism and deep spirituality inherent in Whitman. Altogether, this complete edition may be called monumental in our literature.</p><p>NOVEMBER BOUGHS By Walt Whitman.</p><p>Time only can determine the exact place which Walt Whitman is to occupy among the world's thinkers; and meanwhile it is instructive and interesting to learn from this volume something of the origin, growth, and purpose of his Leaves of Grass, the volume of verse around which so much controversy has raged. In the opening essay, entitled 'A Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads,' the author discusses this work with candor and at length, explaining the motives that prompted it and the philosophy of life that it attempts to expound. The essay is certainly interesting and throws a great deal of valuable light upon the spirit that pervades the Leaves of Grass, as well as upon its peculiar form. The first quality which the author claims for this body of verse is its suggestiveness, and as regards the lines that have called forth the most criticism, he says 'the work must stand or fall with them, as the human body and soul must remain as an entirety.' The author's later verse makes the second division of the book, and is gathered under the title, 'Sands at Seventy.' The latter half of the book consists of papers of varying length on literary, personal, and other themes, much of it vigorous in expression and full of suggestiveness. A portrait of the author taken from life in his seventieth year is the frontispiece of the book, and is reproduced on the opposite page. [David Mackay, Philadelphia, 8vo, $1.25.]</p><p><strong>A NEW BOOK BY MR. WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>A new book has just come to us from America, from Mr. Walt Whitman. It is entitled 'November Boughs,' and is but a little volume of one hundred and forty pages, of which only nineteen are devoted to poetry: the rest are taken up with short, unconnected articles upon a variety of subjects. Here are the headings of some of them; 'Our Eminent Visitors,' 'The Bible as Poetry,' 'Robert Burns as Poet and Person,' 'A Word about Tennyson,' 'Slang in America,' 'Some War Memoranda,' 'Elias Hicks.'</p><p>Yet this volume, small as it is, has a particular and a very great interest. I here use this expression with more than usual significance, use it by no means as a mere commonplace compliment. The book opens with an article of thirteen pages, called 'A Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads.' We find in it a review by Mr. Whitman of all his past work, a quiet exposition of what have been his intentions and aims, of what he hopes and expects for the future of America and of the world. It is this opening article, then, which gives the new volume its greatest, its unique value. We may agree or we may disagree with Mr. Whitman, but there can be no mistake any more as to what he means and what he desires: here is his own clear summary of all that he has given us, the summary of thirty years' enthusiastic life and work.</p><p>I am not to attempt in any sense a review of 'November Boughs,' but merely call attention to its publication. Probably by the time this notice is in print the book will be in the hands of the English publishers, and, if I may express a hope, in those of not a few English readers. I confine myself for the moment entirely to the opening article; and I will try by a series of quotations from it to give some idea of what Mr. Whitman tells us about himself, and some foretaste of how much of suggestive, of immense and even absorbing interest there is in store for those, who shall by-and-bye possess and read the book for themselves.</p><p>'After completing my poems,' then, writes Mr. Whitman, 'I am curious to review them in the light of their own (at the time unconscious, or mostly unconscious) intentions,with certain unfoldings of the thirty years they seek to embody.' 'I look upon 'Leaves of Grass' as my definitive carte visite to the coming generations of the New World.' 'That I have not gain'd the acceptance of my own time; that from a worldly and business point of view 'Leaves of Grass' has been worse than a failure—that public criticism on the book and myself shows mark'd anger and contempt more than anything else; and that solely for publishing it I have been the object of two or three pretty serious special official buffetings—is all probably no more than I ought to have expected. I had my choice when I commenced. I bid neither for soft eulogies, big money returns, nor the approbation of existing schools and conventions.' 'The best comfort of the whole business is that I have had my say entirely my own way—the value thereof to be decided by time.'</p><p>Then as to the nature of 'Leaves of Grass.' 'It gives one man's identity, ardors, observations, faiths, and thoughts, color'd hardly at all with any decided coloring from other faiths or other identities.' 'I would sing, and leave out or put in, quite solely with reference to America and to-day.' 'The true use for the imaginative faculty of modern times is to give ultimate vivification to facts, to science, and to common lives, endowing them with the glows and glories and final illustriousness which belong to every real thing, and to real things only. Without that ultimate vivification, which the poet or other artist alone can give, reality would seem incomplete, and science, democracy, and life itself, finally in vain.' 'I know very well that my 'Leaves' could not possibly have emerged from any other era than the latter half of the Nineteenth Century, nor any other land than democratic America, and from the absolute triumph of the National Union arms.' 'The Old World has had the poems of myths, fictions, feudalism, conquest, caste, dynastic wars, and splendid exceptional characters and affairs, which have been great: but the New World needs the poems of realities and science, and of the democratic average and basic equality, which shall be greater. In the centre of all, and object of all, stands the Human Being, towards whose heroic and spiritual evolution poems and everything directly or indirectly tend, Old World or New.' ''Leaves of Grass' is avowedly the song of Sex and Amativeness, and even Animality.' 'Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath of life to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been left unwritten were those lines omitted.' 'But it is not on 'Leaves of Grass' distinctively as literature, that I feel to dwell or advance claims. No one will get at my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary performance.'</p><p>Then this, lastly, 'for the imaginative genius of the West, when it worthily rises—really great poetry is always the result of a national spirit, and not the privilege of a polish'd and select few: the strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung.'</p><p>No one can read this 'Backward Glance' of Mr. Whitman's without being moved by its simplicity, its noble tone, its pathos. It is the voice of an old prophet in benediction and farewell. Across the waters of the Atlantic he holds out his hand to us; let us clasp it fervently: let us bow with reverence to receive that blessing, with which he bids us be of good cheer and go forward.</p><p>SELWYN IMAGE.</p><p><strong>'November Boughs.'</strong></p><p>The best things in 'November Boughs,' by Walt Whitman, are a few sonnets and prose articles. The bulk of the book will prove tedious to all except his admirers, and nothing that he might write will daunt this loyal band. Those who have established the cult of any author always go to the extreme of hero-worship. This is seen in the Browning societies of England and this country, and it finds equal expression in the Whitman coterie. The very uncouthness of Whitman appears to give pleasure to these people, and they are never tired of praising what has been called his 'heroic nudity.' In the first article in this volume, written at 70, Whitman attempts again to justify 'Leaves of Grass.' To use a phrase of Henry James, 'he regards himself too seriously,' and it makes one smile to read the frequent references to Goethe, Milton and other bards with whom Walt compares himself. What he says about his motive in writing this work which has called down on him so much orthodox condemnation is honestly and plainly stated, but we think he values the poem too highly and that it cannot in any sense be taken as the voice of a representative American of the latter half of this century. Whitman has always seemed very un-American in many of his traits, notably in his acceptance of gifts from friends and in his lack of ambition. That he has many genuine poetic ideas, even in his old age, is evident to any one who reads this collection of his later writings, but these ideas seldom find adequate expression. The mannerisms, both of his prose and his verse, check all perfect development, and one can only fancy what they might have been put in rhythmical verse or prose. The book has a good portrait of Whitman taken in his seventieth year.</p><p>[Philadelphia: David McKay. For sale by J.W. Roberts & Co., 10 Post street.]</p><p><strong>Walt Whitman's 'November Boughs'*</strong></p><p>ORDINARILY, one associates 'November boughs' with flown birds, vanished scents, tattered foliage, skies of steel. Nature like a Greek athlete is stripped for the winter wrestle. Already there is a shimmer of frozen rivers in the distance, a ripple of soft reverberations from vanished summer echoing in memory only -even a prophecy of the boreal flare in the northern sky. The sap is down: the skeleton arms are up: all the infinite articulations of tree and leaf, the lovely geometries of interlacing branches, bare to the quick: everything is ready for the long, long sleep.</p><p>Is this true of Walt Whitman's book? In a sense; it is a preparation for the long sleep—a touching, ave et vale; apparently the author's greeting and salutation and—good bye. But in another sense it might just as well have been christened 'May-blossoms' or 'Leafy June,' or anything else suggestive of richness, luxuriance, juice and bloom, for all are there in springtime abundance, even a group of new poems—'Sands at Seventy,'—delectably sandwiched between the Introduction and 'Our Eminent Visitors' (republished from THE CRITIC). Sap at seventy is seldom so affluent as it is in this striking volume, binding up the life-long thoughts of a revolutionist in verse, an evolutionist in belief; and it runs up and along these 'November boughs' with a great urge and palpitation that expands and freights them to bursting. One can fancy them all over tingling with red blood to their pith. Themistocles1 drank bull's blood and then died of it as a poison. Here there is no thought of poison or death except as the horizon of all things, the garde-fou that like a banister keeps men from tumbling over into annihilation. Succulence, marrow, poetic feeling course through the book exultantly.</p><p>All the author's essential things are here: beliefs, faiths, theories, practices; monologuing, apologuing; strong-hearted democracy; camaraderie and bonhomie; interspersed with wonderfully graphic tableaux of memoranda (if one may so speak) gathered and grouped from his hospital and Indian Bureau memories. So the prophets spake: in brief puffs and pulsations like these: Orphic utterances that expire in a sigh or a hexameter: moods of norn and sibyl run into speech as molten glass is run into forms; short, quick, pregnant flashes of reminiscence that expand into a picture or a pictured paragraph without a moment's hesitation. The most remarkable part of the book is its first heart-beat: 'A Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads,' which one might number as strophe α in a Greek ode, all the other essays and fragments being epodes, after-songs, echoes of the initial trumpet-blast. In this preface the author reaffirms himself, his poetic position, his heresies, his art theory, his democratic dreams: he stands or falls by 'Leaves of Grass,' and he denounces with a Shakspeare-like malediction all who would disturb the 'bones' of his work or who would fig-leaf or expurgate it. Whether his theory of verse-form be true or false, it finds its justification in the times, which demand something new, and has at least a foundation in the noble unmetered verse of the Bible.</p><p>Along with this 'Everlasting Yea' or chapter of re-affirmation go little singing essays and excerpts in marvellously nervous prose labelled with this or that title: 'The Bible as Poetry'; 'Father Taylor and Oratory'; 'A Word about Tennyson' (originally published in this journal, together with 'What Lurks behind Shakspeare's Historical Plays,' 'Five Thousand Poems', and 'Yonnondio'). The soul looks out through these jewelled eyes: they are windows of the poet's soul looking toward Jerusalem. Father Taylor moved the 'good gray poet' as no orator had ever done before. In the essay on 'Slang in America,' there is food for the philologist. The War memoranda and glimpses of hospital life contained in them are Tacitean2 in brevity and picturesqueness, everywhere quick and alive with pathos and pity. The woes of Andromache3 quail before these. It is this great fiery chasm of woe into which the artist looked for an instant, with all its Dantesque horror, and then, brooding over brotherhood, union, democracy, sang 'Leaves of Grass,' 'My Captain,' 'Calamus,' and all that me quoque which forms the essential germ of the Whitman gospel: egotism not as an abstraction but as an intensely concrete, kindled, personal necessity of modern democratic verse asserting itself triumphantly. Other blossoms of these November Boughs are 'Abraham Lincoln,' which is as beautiful as an epigram of Simonides;4 'New Orleans in 1848'; 'Last of the War Cases'; 'Elias Hicks'; and 'The Old Bowery.' The latter is a theatrical efflorescence: full of notes and historiettes of the magical times of the elder Booth, Charles Kean, Mario, Alboni, and the old Park Theatre: a 'bough' hung thick with leaf and fruit and clustering recollection.</p><p>On the whole, all these 'boughs' together make a very rich bouquet, tied at every twig with a love-knot for the reader, and full of the unction and eloquence of a most sweet personality.</p><p>———</p><p>∗ November Boughs By Walt Whitman. $1.25. Philadelphia: David McKay.</p><p><strong>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO WALT WHITMAN.*</strong></p><p>'No one will get at my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary performance, or as aiming mainly towards art and æstheticism. Leaves of Grass has been chiefly the outcropping of my own emotional and other personal nature—an attempt from first to last to put a Person, a human being (myself, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, in America) freely, fully and truly on record. I could not find any similar personal record in current literature that satisfied me.' In these words Walt Whitman gives us the true attitude we should adopt towards his work, having indeed a much saner view of the value and meaning of that work than either his eloquent admirers or noisy detractors can boast of possessing. His last book, November Boughs as he calls it, published in the winter of the old man's life, reveals to us, not indeed a soul's tragedy, for its last note is one of joy and hope and noble and unshaken faith in all that is fine and worthy of such faith, but certainly the drama of a human soul, and puts on record with a simplicity that has in it both sweetness and strength the record of his spiritual development and of the aim and motive both of the manner and the matter of his work. His strange mode of expression is shown in these pages to have been the result of deliberate and self-conscious choice. The 'barbaric yawp,' which he sent over 'the roofs of the world' so many years ago, and which wrung from Mr. Swinburne's lips such lofty panegyric in song and such loud clamorous censure in prose, appears here in what will be to many an entirely new light. For in his very rejection of art Walt Whitman is an artist. He tried to produce a certain effect by certain means and he succeeded. There is much method in what many have termed his madness, too much method indeed some may be tempted to fancy.</p><p>In the story of his life, as he tells it to us, we find him at the age of sixteen beginning a definite and philosophical study of literature:—</p><p>Summers and falls, I used to go off, sometimes for a week at a stretch, down in the country, or to Long Island's seashores—there in the presence of outdoor influences, I went over thoroughly the Old and New Testaments, and absorb'd (probably to better advantage for me than in any library or indoor room—it makes such difference where you read) Shakspere, Ossian, the best translated versions I could get of Homer, Æschylus, Sophokles, the old German Nibelungen, the ancient Hindoo poems, and one or two other masterpieces, Dante's among them. As it happen'd I read the latter mostly in an old wood. The Iliad I read first thoroughly on the peninsula of Orient, north-east end of Long Island, in a sheltered hollow of rocks and sand, with the sea on each side. (I have wondered since why I was not overwhelmed by those mighty masters. Likely because I read them, as described, in the full presence of Nature, under the sun, with the far-spreading landscapes and vistas, or the sea rolling in.)</p><p>Edgar Allan Poe's amusing bit of dogmatism that, for our occasions and for our day, there can be no such thing as a long poem, fascinated him: 'The same thought had been haunting my mind before,' he says, 'but Poe's argument, though short, work'd the sum out and proved it to me:' and the English translation of the Bible seems to have suggested to him the possibility of a poetic form which while retaining the spirit of poetry would still be free from the trammels of rhyme and of a definite metrical system. Having thus to a certain degree settled upon what one might call the technique of Whitmanism, he began to brood upon the nature of that spirit that was to give life to the strange form. The central point of the poetry of the future seemed to him to be necessarily 'an identical body and soul,' a personality in fact, which personality he tells us frankly, 'after many considerations and ponderings I deliberately settled should be myself.' However for the true creation and revealing of this personality, at first only dimly felt, a new stimulus was needed. This came from the Civil War. After describing the many dreams and passions of his boyhood and early manhood he goes on to say:—</p><p>These, however, and much more might have gone on and come to naught (almost positively would have come to naught) if a sudden, vast, terrible, direct and indirect stimulus for new and national declamatory expression had not been given to me. It is certain, I say, that, although I had made a start before, only from the occurrence of the Secession War, and what it showed me as by flashes of lightning, with the emotional depths it sounded and arous'd (of course, I don't mean in my own heart only, I saw it just as plainly in others, in millions) that only from the strong flare and provocation of that war's sights and scenes the final reasons-for-being of an autochthonic and passionate song definitely came forth. I went down to the war-fields of Virginia, lived thenceforward in camp, saw great battles and the days and nights afterwards—partook of all the fluctuations, gloom, despair, hopes again aroused, courage evoked—death readily risked—the cause too—along and filling those agonistic and lurid following years, the real parturition years of the henceforth homogeneous Union. Without those three or four years and the experiences they gave, 'Leaves of Grass' would not now be existing.</p><p>Having thus obtained the necessary stimulus for the quickening and awakening of the personal self, some day to be endowed with universality, he sought to find new notes of song, and passing beyond the mere passion for expression—he aimed at 'Suggestiveness' first. 'I round and finish little, if anything; and could not, consistently with my scheme. The reader will have his or her part to do, just as much as I have had mine. I seek less to state or display any theme of thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the theme or thought—there to pursue your own flight.' Another 'impetus word' is Comradeship, and other 'word-signs' are Good Cheer, Content, and Hope. Individuality, especially, he sought for:—</p><p>I have allowed the stress of my poems from beginning to end to bear upon American individuality and assist it—not only because that is a great lesson in Nature, amid all her generalizing laws, but as a counterpoise to the levelling tendencies of Democracy—and for other reasons. Defiant of ostensible literary and other conventions, I avowedly chant 'the great pride of a man in himself,' and permit it to be more or less a motif of nearly all my verse. I think this pride indispensable to an American. I think it not inconsistent with obedience, humility, deference, and self-questioning.</p><p>∗∗∗</p><p>A new theme also was to be found in the relation of the sexes, conceived in a natural, simple, and healthy form, and he protests against poor Mr. William Rossetti's attempt to Bowdlerize and expurgate his song.</p><p>From another point of view 'Leaves of Grass' is avowedly the song of Sex, and Amativeness, and even Animality—though meanings that do not usually go with these words are behind all, and will duly emerge; and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and atmosphere. Of this feature intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been left unwritten were those lines omitted…Universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their normal recognizance. Literature is always calling in the doctor for consultation and confession, and always giving evasions and swathing suppressions in place of that 'heroic nudity' on which only a genuine diagnosis can be built. And in respect to editions of 'Leaves of Grass' in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years, and to hereby prohibit, as far as mine can do so, any elision of them.</p><p>∗∗∗</p><p>But beyond all these notes and moods and motives is the lofty spirit of a grand and free acceptance of all things that are worthy of existence. 'I desired,' he says, 'to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should indirectly or directly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom, health, mystery, or beauty of every process, every concrete object, every human or other existence, not only consider'd from the point of view of all, but of each.' His two final utterances are that really great poetry is always the result of a national spirit, and not the privilege of a polished and select few; and that the sweetest and strongest songs yet remain to be sung.</p><p>Such are the views contained in the opening essay, 'A Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads,' as he calls it: but there are many other essays in this fascinating volume, some on poets such as Burns and Lord Tennyson, for whom Walt Whitman has a profound admiration: some on old actors and singers, the elder Booth, Forrest, Alboni, and Mario being his special favourites: others on the native Indians, on the Spanish element in American nationality, on Western slang, on the poetry of the Bible, and on Abraham Lincoln. But Walt Whitman is at his best when he is analyzing his own work, and making schemes for the poetry of the future. Literature to him has a distinctly social aim. He seeks to build up the masses by 'building up grand individuals.' And yet literature itself must be preceded by noble forms of life. 'The best literature is always the result of something far greater than itself—not the hero but the portrait of the hero. Before there can be recorded history or poem there must be the transaction.' Certainly in Walt Whitman's views there is a largeness of vision, a healthy sanity, and a fine ethical purpose. He is not to be placed with the professional littérateurs of his country, Boston novelists, New York poets, and the like. He stands apart, and the chief value of his work is in its prophecy not in its performance. He has begun a prelude to larger themes. He is the herald to a new era. As a man he is the precursor of a fresh type. He is a factor in the heroic and spiritual evolution of the human being. If Poetry has passed him by, Philosophy will take note of him.</p><p>∗ 'November Boughs.' By Walt Whitman. (Paisley; and Paternoster-row. London: Alexander Gardner. 1880.)</p><p>One other book from America. Walt Whitman's 'November Boughs,' a story of the poet's life, has been published by Mr. Gardner, of Paternoster-row. Written in the poet's declining years, it is imbued with the sanguine, generous faith in man which characterised his youth. In which respect he differs considerably from his English brother poet—who should have been done with Amy's cousin where he left him nearly half a century before. These November Boughs are a fascinating and most suggestive record of the history of a mind—for of external effect and event there is but little, save the poet's experiences in the great Civil War, the drama of which it was that first made Whitman poetically vocal. In his talk about his reading habits when a boy—reading his Shakespeare, Homer, Dante, Bible—in scenes appropriate to them, there are some delightful passages and expressions that haunt the memory—as when he tells us how he studied Dante in 'an old wood.' The subject is by far too complex for treatment in a paragraph; and we can only say that orthodox critics may, quite possibly, reconsider their judgment of him after they have read the poet's own explanation of how his choice of theme determined the form of expression—justified his rejection of the old-world restraints of rhyme and metre. You may or may not call Whitman a poet—the poet of Democracy—but, if not a poet, he is a prophet of the new time.</p><p><strong>Editor's Study.</strong></p><p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>MR. WALT WHITMAN calls his latest book November Boughs, and in more ways than one it testifies and it appeals beyond the letter to the reader's interest. For the poet the long fight is over; he rests his cause with what he has done; and we think no one now would like to consider the result without respect, without deference, even if one cannot approach it with entire submission. It is time, certainly, while such a poet is still with us, to own that his literary intention was as generous as his spirit was bold, and that if he has not accomplished all he intended, he has been a force that is by no means spent. Apart from the social import of his first book ('without yielding an inch, the working-man and working-woman were to be in my pages from first to last'), he aimed in it at the emancipation of poetry from what he felt to be the trammels of rhyme and metre. He did not achieve this; but he produced a new kind in literature, which we may or may not allow to be poetry, but which we cannot deny is something eloquent, suggestive, moving, with a lawless, formless beauty of its own. He dealt literary conventionality one of those blows which eventually show as internal injuries, whatever the immediate effect seems to be. He made it possible for poetry hereafter to be more direct and natural than hitherto; the hearing which he has braved nearly half a century of contumely and mockery to win would now be granted on very different terms to a man of his greatness. This is always the way; and it is always the way that the reformer (perhaps in helpless confession of the weakness he shares with all humankind) champions some error which seems as dear to him as the truth he was born to proclaim. Walt Whitman was not the first to observe that we are all naked under our clothes, but he was one of the greatest, if not the first, to preach a gospel of nudity; not as one of his Quaker ancestry might have done for a witness against the spiritual nakedness of his hearers, but in celebration of the five senses and their equal origin with the three virtues of which the greatest is charity. His offence, if rank, is quantitatively small, a few lines at most; and it is one which the judicious pencil of the editor will some day remove for him, though for the present he 'takes occasion to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years.' We hope for that day, not only because it will give to all a kind in poetry which none can afford to ignore, and which his cherished lines bar to most of those who read most in our time and country, but because we think the five senses do not need any celebration. In that duality which every thoughtful person must have noticed composes him, we believe the universal experience is that the beast half from first to last is fully able to take care of itself. But it is a vast subject, and, as the poet says, 'it does not stand by itself; the vitality of it is altogether in its relations, bearings, significance.' In the mean while we can assure the reader that these November Boughs are as innocent as so many sprays of apple blossom, and that he may take the book home without misgiving.</p><p>We think he will find in reading it that the prose passages are, some of them, more poetic than the most poetic of the rhythmical passages. 'Some War Memoranda,' and 'The Last of the War Cases'—notes made twenty-five years ago—are alive with a simple pathos and instinct with a love of truth which recall the best new Russian work, and which make the poet's psalms seem vague and thin as wandering smoke in comparison. Yet these have the beauty of undulant, sinuous, desultory smoke forms, and they sometimes take the light with a response of such color as dwells in autumn sunsets. The book is well named November Boughs: it is meditative and reminiscent, with a sober fragrance in it like the scent of fallen leaves in woods where the leaves that still linger overhead,</p><p>Or few, or none, do shake against the cold—<br>Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.</p><p>It is the hymn of the runner resting after the race, and much the same as he chants always, whether the race has been lost or won.</p><p>[ . . .]</p><strong><p>WALT WHITMAN'S LATEST WORK</p><p>———</p><p>'November Boughs' and Estimates of Its Distinguished Author—The Poet's Grounds for 'Leaves of Grass'—Books and Authors.</p><p>———</p><p>With 'November Boughs' the work of Walt Whitman may be considered finished. The age of the poet (he was born in 1819), his infirmity, the suggestive title of the volume, and the character of its contents all indicate that it is the final word, the last farewell, of one who awaits death with the tranquil mind and the clear vision of the prophet.</p><p>Should the life of the poet be spared yet a few years he may, and doubtless will, add something to what now stands as the definitive expression of his thought—a touch here or there, perhaps; a little added emphasis to some principle, an ultimate assertion of his steadfast faith in the creed which both his poetry and his life so nobly exemplify—but the work itself is accomplished, his mission has been fulfilled, his burden has been delivered.</p><p>It is impossible to contemplate the life of this man, with a thorough knowledge of his work or even with an imperfect realization of it, without experiencing a feeling of profound and reverential respect. But we are too near him now to get other than an imperfect view of him; his personality is so great that it crowds the narrow field of our vision; to be adequately grasped and appreciated he must be seen in the perspective of at least one hundred years. His figure then will be sharply outlined against the background of history, and the future will see with unshaded eye and in a light softened and tempered by time that of which the present can get but a partial view.</p><p>It is a matter of no little significance that here has appeared in American literature a man who has had a burden, in the true sense of the word, to deliver. We have and have had poets of very respectable ability, but none of them has had other than an imaginary burden to deliver. They have sung, it is true, and sweetly, too, oftentimes, but they have not sung a new song. In analyzing their work it is easy to find close parallels in preceding literature; in searching for the source of the singer's inspiration it may be found almost always in his literary acquisitions, and the influence of this or that past master of song may be unerringly detected. In short, if their work were swept away we should lose little that is new—nothing that could not be duplicated. But the work of Walt Whitman cannot be duplicated and it can be traced to no external source—it springs directly from himself; it is his own, absolutely.</p><p>The simplicity of his life as a poet is comparable only to that of Washington as a commander, and his patriotism amounts to a religion. So impressed is he with the present grandeur, so confident is he of the ultimate triumph of democracy as it is organized in America, that he deems all conventional forms utterly inadequate to express the ideas which it suggests, the principles which it involves. Rhyme and rhythm, in the accepted sense, he discards as impracticable; the theme is too great; the mode of expression must be commensurate with the sublimity of the subject, a motive very different, be it remarked, from that which is commonly assigned as the reason for his rejection of established poetical forms—the mere wanton rebelliousness of insufferable egotism.</p><p>True to his instinct of democracy, which illuminates every page he has written and which is the great life-giving principle of his poetry, Walt Whitman does not celebrate the great or the exceptional man, neither the mediæval prince nor the antique knight, or the hero of the olden time, but the average man of to-day. He celebrates not only his brain but his hands, not only his soul but also his body. He sings the praises of no individual but of the masses typified in this, to him, superb product, the average man. To him his land is a temple, the principles underlying his government are a religion—his great voice fills the temple, but few hear it, for it sometimes occurs that those having ears do not hear.</p><p>Whatever was that old, old saying that prophet is not without honor save in his own country better exemplified than in the case of Walt Whitman. It would be superfluous to attempt to defend him from the ridicule and abuse to which he has been subjected by his countrymen. No defense is necessary, because such ridicule and abuse are the twin offspring of ignorance and stupidity. People who know absolutely nothing of his writing, either prose or verse, who have not read even 'O Captain, My Captain,' do not hesitate to assail him, to excoriate him, to blackguard him with a vehemence which is pitiful in that it reveals measureless, fathomless depths of ignorance. Others from less unworthy motives have made an outcry on the score of outraged decency, but the one page in all of Walt Whitman's works which may be objected to on this ground is part and parcel of his doctrine—is vital, in fact—and to question the intellectual honesty of the poet on account of it is simply monstrous.</p><p>It is humiliating but true that the recognition which is denied Walt Whitman at home is cheerfully and enthusiastically accorded him abroad. The fact that he is so recognized abroad in no way influences his enemies at home, for the reason that his detractors are of that class who cherish the absurd delusion that the inhabitants of London, Paris, Berlin, and Rome, and the lands which these cities represent, are a weary, dreary, unlucky lot of people who despise their respective countries and to whom life is desperately empty, vapid, and inept. The idea that America is the only place on the face of the earth that is fit to live in, not only for Americans, but also for a Frenchman, an Englishman, or a German, is one of those ridiculous illusions which, of course, the kindly hand of time will eventually dispel.</p><p>Naturally the fullest measure of recognition abroad is found in England, where were it not for the stumbling-block of Walt Whitman's departure from established models, Mr. Edmund Gosse would not have propounded the question 'Has America produced a great poet?' Both the prose and verse of Whitman have long excited the liveliest interest in England, especially among critical and literary people. Even such a master of technique as Swinburne extends the hand of fellowship to Walt Whitman. In his 'Song to Walt Whitman, in America,' beginning—</p><p>'Send but a song over sea to us,<br>Heart of their hearts who are free'—</p><p>occurs in this stanza:</p><p>'O strong-winged soul with prophetic<br>Lips hot with the blood-beats of song,<br>With tremor of heart-strings magnetic,<br>With thoughts as thunders in throng,<br>With consonant ardors of chords<br>That pierce men's souls as with swords<br>And hale them hearing along,<br>Make us too music—'</p><p>Prof. Clifford, Prof. Tyrrell, and other eminent critics have recognized the great significance of his work, while Dante Gabriel Rossetti, in a prefatory notice to a volume of selections from his works, which he has edited, says: 'There is in his poems a singular interchange of actuality and of ideal substratum and suggestion. While he sees men with even abnormal exactness as men, he sees them also 'as trees walking,' and admits us to perceive that the whole show is, in a measure, spectral and unsubstantial, and the mask of a larger and profounder reality beneath it, of which it is giving perpetual intimations and auguries.' In regard to the title of Walt Whitman's more important volume, Mr. Rossetti observes: 'Leaves of Grass' seems to express with some aptness the simplicity, universality, and spontaneity of the poems to which it is applied.'</p><p>In his 'Studies in Literature' Prof. Dowden devotes a chapter to the poetry of Walt Whitman. In 1876 Robert Buchanan, the Scotch poet, published an appeal 'eulogizing and defending the American bard in his old age, illness, and poverty from the swarms of maligners who still continue to assail him.' The appeal contains this passage:</p><p>'He who wanders through the solitudes of far-off Uist or lonely Donegal may often behold the golden eagle sick to death, worn with age or famine, or with both, passing with weary waft of wing from promontory to promontory, from peak to peak, pursued by a crowd of rooks and crows which fall back screaming whenever the noble bird turns his indignant head, and which follow frantically once more, hooting behind him, whenever he wends again upon his way.'</p><p>A Danish critic has said in a Copenhagen magazine:</p><p>'It may be candidly admitted that the American poet has not the elegance, special melody, nor recherche aroma of the accepted poets of Europe or his own country, but his compass and general harmony are infinitely greater. The sweetness and spice, the poetic ennui, the tender longings, the exquisite art finish of these choice poets are mainly unmet and unseen in him—perhaps because he cannot achieve them—more likely because he disdains them. But there is an electric living soul in his poetry far more fermenting and bracing. His wings do not glitter in their movement from rich and varicolored plumage, nor are his notes those of the accustomed song-birds, but his flight is the flight of the eagle.'</p><p>A writer in the French Revue des Deux Mondes has pronounced his war poems, 'the most vivid the most humanly passionate, and the most modern of all the verse of the nineteenth century.' While the German poet Freiligrath, who has translated him into German, hails him as the 'founder of a new democratic and modern order of poetry greater than the old.'</p><p>But Walt Whitman is not without his friends in America, and among them is that charming writer, John Burroughs, who says of his poetry:</p><p>'His lines are pulsations, thrills, waves of force, indefinite dynamics, formless, constantly emanating from the living center, and they carry the quality of the author's personal presence with them in a way that is unprecedented in literature.'</p><p>The last volume of the poet's works, 'November Boughs' (Philadelphia: David McKay), contains more prose than verse. It opens with an essay entitled 'A Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads,' in which the poet reviews his poems 'in the light of their own intentions, with certain unfoldings of the thirty years they seek to embody.'</p><p>Nothing could be more admirable than Walt Whitman's prose style; vigorous, luminous, and picturesque as it is, he well deserves the reputation that he has won in England of having written some of the best prose of the century. In these 'Backward Glances' he refers frequently to 'Leaves of Grass.' For grounds for 'Leaves of Grass' he says:</p><p>'As a poem, I abandoned the conventional themes which do not appear in it. None of the stock ornamentation, or choice plots of love or war, or high, exceptional personages of old-world song; nothing, as I may say, for beauty's sake—no legend, or myth, or romance, nor euphemism, nor rhyme. But the broadest average of humanity and its identities in the now ripening nineteenth century, and especially in each of their countless examples and practical occupations in the United States to-day. ∗∗∗ Few appreciate the moral revolutions, our age, which have been profounder far than the material or inventive or war-produced ones. The nineteenth century now well toward its close (and ripening into fruit the seeds of the two preceding centuries)—the uprising of national masses and shifting of boundary lines—the historical and other prominent facts of the United States—the war of attempted secession—the stormy rush and haste of nebulous forces—never can future years witness more excitement and din of action—never completer change of army-front along the whole line, the whole civilized world. For all these new and evolutionary facts, meanings, purposes, new poetic messages, new forms and expressions, are inevitable. ∗∗∗ Without yielding an inch the workingman and the working woman were to be in my pages from first to last. The ranges of heroism and loftiness with which Greek and feudal poets endow'd their god-like or lordly born characters—indeed, prouder and better based and with fuller ranges than those—I was to endow the democratic averages of America. I was to show that we, here and to-day, are eligible to the grandest and the best—more eligible now than any times of old were. I will also want my utterances to be in spirit poems of the morning. I will want them to be the poems of women entirely as much as men. I have wished to put the complete union of the states in my songs without any preference or partiality whatever. Henceforth, if they live and are read, it must be just as much south as north, just as much along the Pacific as Atlantic, in the valley of the Mississippi, in Canada, up in Maine, down in Texas, on the shores of Puget sound.'</p><p>After these 'Backward Glances' comes 'Sands at Seventy'—a collection of short fugitive poems. These are followed by an admirable essay on 'Our Eminent Visitors—Past, Present, and Future,' in which all—Dickens, Thackeray, Froude, Spenser, Wilde, Coleridge, Matthew Arnold, Irving—are welcomed 'in the whole land's name,' but they are warned that in meeting and surveying 'the etiquettical gatherings of our wealthy, distinguish'd, and sure-to-be-put-forward-on-such-occasions citizens' in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, etc., that in passing through one after another, 'the full-dress coteries of the Atlantic cities, all grammatical, cultured, and correct with the toned-down manners of the gentlemen, and the kid gloves and luncheons and finger-glasses—let not our eminent visitors, we say, suppose that by means of these experiences they have 'seen America' or captured any distinctive clew or purport thereof. Of the pulse-beats that lie within and vitalize this commonweal of to-day, of the hard-pan purports and idiosyncrasies pursued faithfully and triumphantly, by its bulk of men north and south, generation after generation—those coteries do not furnish the faintest scintilla.'</p><p>Then, after several more short essays, including 'The Bible as Poetry,' 'What Lurks Behind Shakspere's Plays,' 'Robert Burns as Poet and Person,' comes 'A Word About Tennyson' And here a word must be said about Walt Whitman's attitude toward the poetry of the past and toward European, particularly English, poetry of to-day. That attitude is by no means revolutionary. Although he has nothing in common with his brother poets so far as matters of form are concerned, he recognizes most generously and appreciates most fully the beauty and the strength of their art products. In the 'Backward Glances' he says: 'The new world receives with joy the poems of the antique, with European feudalism's rich fund of epics, plays, ballads—seeks not in the least to deaden or displace those voices from our ear and area—holds them, indeed, as indispensable studies, influences, records, comparisons.' But, although he calls them the 'most precious bequest to current American civilization from all the hitherto ages,' he asks:</p><p>'Of the great poems receiv'd from abroad and from the ages and to-day enveloping and penetrating America, is there one that is consistent with these United States or essentially applicable to them as they are and are to be? Is there one whose underlying basis is not a denial and insult to democracy? ∗∗∗ I have, indeed, put on record elsewhere my reverence and eulogy for those never-to-be-excell'd poetic bequests and their indescribable preciousness as heirlooms for America. Another and separate point must now be candidly stated. If I had not stood before those poems with uncovered head, fully aware of their colossal grandeur and beauty of form and spirit, I could not have written 'Leaves of Grass.' My verdict and conclusions, as illustrated in its pages, are arrived at through the temper and inculcation of the old works as much as through anything else. As America, fully and fairly construed, is the legitimate result and evolutionary outcome of the past, so I would dare to claim for my verse. Without stopping to qualify the averment, the old world has had the poems of myths, fictions, feudalism, conquest, caste, dynastic wars, and splendid exceptional characters and affairs, which have been great; but the new world needs the poems of realities and science and of the democratic average and basic equality, which shall be greater. In the center of all, and object of all, stands the Human Being, toward whose heroic and spiritual evolution poems and everything else directly or indirectly tend, old world or new.'</p><p>In the light of this comprehensive exposition of the poet's attitude one is prepared to read intelligently the following paragraph in 'A Word About Tennyson':</p><p>'Let me assume to pass Verdict, or perhaps momentary judgment, for the United States on this poet—a removed and distant position giving some advantages over a nigh one. What is Tennyson's service to his race, times, and especially to America? First I should say—or at least, nor forget—his personal character. He is not to be mentioned as a rugged, evolutionary, aboriginal force—but (and a great lesson is in it) he has been consistent throughout with the native, healthy, patriotic spinal element and promptings of himself. His moral line is local and conventional, but it is vital and genuine. He reflected the upper-crust of his time, its pale cast of thought, even its ennui. Then the simile of my friend, John Burroughs, is entirely true, 'his glove is a glove of silk, but the hand is a hand of iron.' He shows how one can be a poet laureate, quite elegant and 'aristocratic,' and a little queer and affected, and at the same time perfectly manly and natural. As to his non-democracy, it fits him well and I like him the better for it. I guess we all like to have (I am sure I do) some one who presents those sides of a thought, or possibility, different from our own—different and yet with a sort of home likeness—a tartness and contradiction offsetting the theory as we view it, and construed from tastes and proclivities not at all his own. To me, Tennyson shows more than any poet I know (perhaps has been a warning to me) how much there is in finest verbalism. There is such a latent charm in mere words, cunning collocutions, and in the voice ringing them, which he has caught and brought out, beyond all others—as in the line,</p><p>''And hollow, hollow, hollow, all delight,'</p><p>in the 'Passing of Arthur,' and evidenced in 'The Lady of Shalott,' and many other pieces. His mannerism is very great, but it is a noble and welcome mannerism. His very best work, to me, is contained in the books of 'The Idyls of the King,' and all that has grown out of them. Though indeed we could spare nothing of Tennyson however small or however peculiar—not 'Break, Break,' nor 'Flower in the Crannied Wall,' nor the old and eternally told passion of 'Edward Gray.'</p><p>It is a rising, not a setting, sun that bursts through these 'November Boughs'; how, in its intense and all-pervading light, the glowworm-like phases of literary activity-particularly in the way of fiction, the all-absorbing discussion of which is just now the passing 'fashionable fad'—pale their ineffectual fires.</p><p><em>November Boughs</em> By Walt Whitman. (Alexander Gardner.)</p><p>To persons who are not already well-disposed toward Walt Whitman and his work, this collection of November Boughs offers little to attract and at the same time little to repel. It seems to be hardly intended for such persons at all. Those who have not discovered what may be termed the secret of Whitman in Leaves of Grass and in Democratic Vistas are not likely to discover it in the pages of this new volume; and impartial students, who wish to judge for themselves, must still be referred to the author's earlier writings.</p><p>Yet to persons—and they are many now—who are already well-disposed toward Walt Whitman and his work, the volume will be welcome. It will please and interest them as the later expression of a man whom they admire. It consists for the most part of fugitive pieces in prose and in verse, some gathered from magazines, others printed now for the first time. Readers in England have seen several of them in the convenient 'Camelot' volume published last year and reviewed at the time in the ACADEMY. Two prose pieces which appeared there under the titles 'My Book and I' and 'How I made a Book' are now brought together and newly entitled—'A Backward Glance o'er Travell'd Roads.' The papers on Shakspeare, on Burns as Poet and Person, and on Tennyson, also reappear; but most of the other contents of the book are not so familiar. There is an interesting reminiscence of Father Taylor, who, though 'an orthodox minister of no particular celebrity, who, during a long life, preached especially to Yankee sailors in an old fourth-class church down by the wharves of Boston,' was, in the opinion of Walt Whitman, 'the only essentially perfect orator' he ever heard. Interesting, also, are the somewhat fuller notes on another famous preacher—Elias Hicks. Whitman's parents were 'Hicksite' Quakers; and Whitman himself, in his early days, saw something of the great Quaker heretic, and derived therefrom deep and lasting impressions. He traces a resemblance between Elias Hicks and Father Taylor:</p><p>'Years afterward, in Boston, I heard Father Taylor, the sailor's preacher, and found in his passionate, unstudied oratory the resemblance to Elias Hicks's—not argumentative or intellectual, but so penetrating—so different from anything in the books (different as the fresh air of a May morning, or seashore breeze, from the atmosphere of a perfumer's shop)' (p. 128). Of Elias Hicks himself, Walt Whitman writes:</p><p>'The true Christian religion (such was the teaching of Elias Hicks) consists neither in rights, or Bibles, or sermons, or Sundays—but in noiseless secret ecstasy and unremitted aspiration, in purity, in a good practical life, in charity to the poor and toleration to all. He said, 'A man may keep the Sabbath, may belong to a church and attend all the observances, have regular family prayer, keep a well-bound copy of the Hebrew scriptures in a conspicuous place in his house, and yet not be a truly religious person at all.' E. believ'd little in a church as organiz'd—even his own—with houses, ministers, or with salaries, creeds, Sundays, saints, Bibles, holy festivals, &c. But he believ'd always in the universal Church, in the soul of man, invisibly rapt, ever waiting, ever responding to universal truths. He was fond of pithy proverbs. He said, 'It matters not where you live, but how you live.' He said once to my father, 'They talk of the devil—I tell thee, Walter, there is no worse devil than man'' (pp. 128-9).</p><p>A man like this was a man after Walt Whitman's own heart.</p><p>The poetical pieces—in the old familiar form—are of varying merit. There is a vivid descriptive touch in that on 'Broadway':</p><p>'What hurrying human tides, or day or night!<br>What passions, winnings, losses, ardors, swim <br>thy waters!<br>What whirls of evil, bliss and sorrow, stem thee!<br>What curious questioning glances—glints of love!<br>Leer, envy, scorn, contempt, hope, aspiration!<br>Thou portal—thou arena—thou of the myriad <br>long drawn lines and groups!<br>(Could but thy flagstones, curbs, façades, tell <br>their inimitable tales;<br>Thy windows rich, and huge hotels—thy side— <br>walks wide):<br>Thou of the endless sliding, mincing, shuffling <br>feet!<br>Thou, like the parti-coloured world itself—like <br>infinite, teeming, mocking life!<br>Thou visor'd, vast, unspeakable show and <br>lesson!' (p. 28.)</p><p>Two lines called 'The Bravest Soldiers' are characteristic:</p><p>'Brave, brave were the soldiers (high named to-<br>day) who lived through the fight;<br>But the bravest pressed to the front, and fell, <br>unnamed, unknown' (p. 20).</p><p>Yet, after all, that is only partly true; even some who pressed to the front may not have fallen. I think few persons—however they may object to some of his methods—would deny the bravery of the 'good grey poet' himself, yet happily he has not fallen, but has lived to celebrate his triumph. His purpose has been achieved. I do not mean that he has converted the world, or that he has vanquished all ill-will; but he has compelled attention and has won regard. He is no longer scorned or laughed at. He has even achieved such respectability that in some newspapers he is called 'Mr.' Whitman—a form of respect which, I fear, he does not duly appreciate. Nay, more! Mr. Swinburne, who has a genius for saying things out of due season, has abused him. And all this has been secured without compromise on Whitman's part. He has abandoned nothing, and may therefore enjoy his triumph without regret of any kind. Old age has come upon him, it is true, and with it increasing bodily infirmities. An occasional undertone of sadness in the present volume points to this. But, for the most part, we see in these pages the same hopeful, cheery, affectionate, and great-souled man and poet, whom we have known so long. Old age has not touched his heart, and it is impossible to believe that it ever will.</p><p>WALTER LEWIN.</p><p>Here is Walt Whitman's November Boughs (David Mackay & Co.), a collection of pieces in prose and verse. To the people who live in the appearances of things, to the people who love shams and conventions, to the people who worship the isms which the past has bequeathed, Whitman has no message to convey. He does not live in the trim little parterre which human genius has reduced to order, he is a portion of the great unconquered chaos that surrounds us here, there, and everywhere. His voice comes far away from the distance. You have to pause to listen, and are not always sure you have heard aright, but somehow you feel that the very Distance is the truest part of yourself, and that the far-off voice reveals to you the deeps of your own soul. The things you have vaguely felt are here uttered, and then for the first time perhaps you recognize that you have felt them. Whitman himself tells us in his excellent preliminary essay 'A Backward Glance o'er Travelled Roads' that the word he would put primarily for the description of his Leaves of Grass is the word Suggestiveness. 'I round and finish little, if anything; and could not, consistently with my scheme. The reader will always have his or her part to do, just as much as I have had mine. I seek less to state or display any theme or thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the theme or thought, - there to pursue your own flight.' But the most characteristic and illuminating passage in this essay is where Whitman tells us, 'Ever since what might be call'd thought, or the budding of thought, fairly began in my youthful mind, I had had a desire to attempt some worthy record of that entire faith and acceptance ('to justify the ways of God to man' is Milton's well-known and ambitious phrase) which is the foundation of moral America. I felt it all as positively then in my young days as I do now in my old ones; to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should directly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom, health, mystery, beauty of every process, every concrete object, every human or other existence, not only consider'd from the point of view of all, but of each. While I can not understand it or argue it out, I fully believe in a clue and purpose in Nature, entire and several; and that invisible spiritual results, just as real and definite as the visible, eventuate all concrete life and all materialism, through Time. My book ought to emanate buoyancy and gladness legitimately enough, for it was grown out of those elements, and has been the comfort of my life since it was originally commenced.'</p><p><strong>The Library</strong></p><p>———</p><p>A poet's prose is sure to be attractive. Walt Whitman's 'November Boughs' has a streak of intentional verse in it, but the prose papers of which it is mainly composed speak aloud of the peculiar poetic temperament behind them. We look at various subjects through the good poet's eyes: at 'Our Eminent Visitors, past, present, and future,'—a brilliant motley procession,—Dickens, Thackeray, Spencer, Oscar Wilde, Matthew Arnold, Henry Irving; at 'The Bible as Poetry;' 'A Word about Tennyson;' 'Slang in America;' 'Father Taylor and Oratory;' 'What lurks behind Shakespeare's Historical Plays;' or at some jottings of personal reminiscence,—'War Memoranda,' 'Notes on Elias Hicks,' etc.; in each we gain a large, though brief and passing, glimpse of the subject viewed; from each some added impression of the breadth, the democratic kindliness, and homespun sense that marks the very soul and gait of our American Walt Whitman.</p><p>Very readable papers are these, but not only for their own sakes. In them we feel that the poet's prose takes us, in a way, behind the scenes of his criticised rhythmical stage-settings and shows us anew the 'sign and note and character' of the poet's poetry.</p><p>The introductory paper, 'A Backward Glance o'er Travelled Roads,' openly welcomes us to confidence. It tells plainly much of that which we can scarcely imagine any intelligent reader of poetry would let pass by unread and unheeded. In the verses given and entitled 'Sands at Seventy' we would choose out 'Had I the Choice,' 'You Tides with Ceaseless Swell,' 'Proudly the Flood comes in,' and 'By that Long Scan of Waves,' as telling the same story in Whitman's best way,—the story of the part he has distinctively chosen to uphold amid the democratic flood of peoples that he loves.</p><p>He tells it to much the same effect and more specifically in the introductory paper from which we extract this comment on his own 'Leaves of Grass' and other poems:</p><p>'The word I myself put primarily for the description of them as they stand at last is the word Suggestiveness. I round and finish little, if anything; and could not consistently with my scheme. The reader will always have his or her part to do, just as much as I have had mine. I seek less to state or display any theme or thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the theme or thought,—there to pursue your own flight. Another impetus word is Comradeship as for all lands, and in a more commanding and acknowledged sense that hitherto. Other sign words would be Good Cheer, Content, and Hope . . . .</p><p>''Leaves of Grass' indeed (I cannot too often reiterate) has mainly been the outcropping of my own emotional and other personal nature—an attempt, from first to last, to put a person, a human being (myself, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, in America), freely, fully, and truly on record. I could not find any similar personal record in current literature that satisfied me. But it is not on 'Leaves of Grass' distinctively as literature, or a specimen thereof, that I feel to dwell or advance claims. No one will get at my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary performance, or as aiming mainly toward art or aestheticism.'</p><p>(David McKay: Philadelphia.)</p><p><strong>NOVEMBER BOUGHS.*</strong></p><p>IN this small volume, by a man whose name has been the occasion of as much pen-and-ink fighting as most names in the last half of the nineteenth century, there is extremely little contentious matter. Most of it is prose—to anticipate the rather superfluous and stale jibes on the subject, let us say intentional prose—and the small section which is not contains nothing aggressive. Most of it is, again, a mere collection of the casual articles for newspapers and magazines by which the author is known to eke out his means of subsistence. Only in the first article, perhaps, which is a kind of review or reflection upon his own literary history, does Walt Whitman make much addition to his characteristic work; and this is not in the least combative. On the contrary, it seems to us to be singularly modest—not at all with the sham modesty which a vain old man who is proud of what he has done sometimes affects. Mr. Whitman says, in a manner which, if irony were not a mode rather foreign to him, we should consider ironical, that 'William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke are much more peremptory' in estimating his value than he is. We should be very much surprised if they were not. William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke (we use these names with all apologies to the eminent possessors, of whom we know very little, as types) usually are 'more peremptory,' and may usually be neglected. We have no concern with William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke. If we have concern with Mr. Whitman (he would not like to be called Mr., but he has done what he likes himself for the most part, and we shall imitate him), it is less with this particular little volume than with his whole work. That work, or rather the important part of it—for little that has appeared since makes much difference—was reviewed in the earliest days of the Saturday Review by a very eminent hand. We shall not say that it was unjustly reviewed, nor do we think so. From certain points of view Walt Whitman deliberately laid himself open to what he has abundantly received—the process technically known as 'slating.' If a man will, by no means without truth, announce his completed intention of emitting a 'barbaric yawp,' he must reckon with the expression of the sentiments of persons who do not like barbaric yawps. If he will, in season and out of season, praise an irrational variety of polity, which has never yet been tried with real success in any age of the world's history, he must lay his account with harsh answers from people who utterly decline to sacrifice the freedom of forty-nine wise men to the tyranny of fifty-one fools. If he chooses to dilate on subjects which the world usually keeps sub rosa, for many wise reasons—not the least wise being that they lose half their charm and interest if the Rose presides not at the discussion of them—here, too, he must take the consequences. If, desiring to be new, he rushes to cheap and obvious ways of being, not new, but merely novel, employs a grotesque vocabulary, and discards the ornaments of rhyme and of recognized verse, he cannot eat the cake of eccentricity and yet have that of classic recognition. And we conceive that a critic has a right, if he likes, to visit all these provoked consequences on the provoker's head, whatever William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke may say. We must repeat that it does not in the least matter what they do say. The whole tale of this new 'Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads' amounts to an acknowledgment by Walt Whitman himself, not that his critics were right—very far from that—but that he had nothing else to expect. Of course he reiterates—not vehemently, as of old, but vigorously enough—his standard doctrines that democratic America wants something newer and better than the old poetry, and that his poetry is not an achievement (William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke say that), but an experiment in the way of giving a new form to democratic America. There are even faint glimpses (though he seems to recoil from them with horror, and says 'Great is democratic America!' as his new Om-mani-padmi-hom, many times to wash himself clean of the fact of sin) that 'modern science and democracy appear to be eliminating something that gives the last majesty to man.'</p><p>Now it seems to us that Walt Whitman's unfavourable critics hitherto have rather failed to distinguish between the faults which false premises to start from and a misconceived aim to tend to have produced in him on the one side, and the faculties, and even to a certain extent the accomplishments as a poet, which in spite of all these evil influences he has displayed on the other. It is very rare, indeed, to find an admirer of his who does not sympathize with some, at least, of his principles; it is almost an unknown thing to find a critic who dislikes him, and whose dislike is not based either on dislike of his political, religious, and moral standpoints, or else on an unwillingness to admit the 'barbaric yawp' because there is so much yawp in it, and it is so barbaric. Yet this is certainly wrong, nor is it quite universal. We, for instance, who write here to-day willingly make a present of almost every general principle of his to the enemy to be given up to chaos and old night. So far is it from being the case that the United States of America present a higher type of civilization and of humanity, that we should count the grey New Yorker rather lower than the European child. Democracy, instead of being a great and beautiful goddess, is a dirty, half-witted trull. Instead of its being a good thing to do as Whitman has tried to do, to put a person fully, freely, and truly on record, the first and the last rule of the poet should be, not indeed to work impersonally, but to pass every personal emotion through the sieve of the universal, to 'disrealize' everything, to bring it into union with the whole. We hold that, whether it is desirable or not to say to 'the perfect girl who understands you' the things that Whitman says, it is infinitely better not to shout such conversation on the housetops; that to talk about 'me imperturbe' is silly, not impressive; that rhythmical staves of prose are infinitely more difficult, as well as much more rarely effective, than the common rhyme-assisted measures, and so forth. All this is granted by us, or rather spontaneously asserted, and if William O'Connor and Dr. Bucke do not like it, we cannot help that. And then we face round, and ask simply whether this is not poetry?—</p><p>Come, lovely and soothing Death,<br>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,<br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>Sooner or later, delicate Death.</p><p>Praised be the fathomless universe,<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious;<br>And for love, sweet love—but praise! praise! praise!<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death.</p><p>Dark Mother! always gliding near, with soft feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee—I glorify thee above all;<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.</p><p>Approach, strong Deliveress!<br>When it is so—when thou hast taken them, I joyously sing the dead,<br>Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,<br>Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death!</p><p>From me to thee glad serenades,<br>Dances for thee I propose, saluting thee—adornments and feastings for <br>thee;<br>And the sights of the open landscape, and the high-spread sky, are <br>fitting,<br>And life, and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.</p><p>The night, in silence, under many a star;<br>The ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know;<br>And the soul turning to thee, O vast and well-veiled Death!<br>And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.</p><p>Over the tree-tops I float thee a song!<br>Over the rising and sinking waves—over the myriad fields and the prairies <br>wide:<br>Over the dense-packed cities all, and the teeming wharves and ways,<br>I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee, O Death!</p><p>This exquisite poem—for we do not hesitate to call it so—was indeed not in the original 'Leaves of Grass,' as it appeared more than thirty years ago, nor were the 'Sea-shore Memories,' the next best thing that Whitman has done. But the quality, less conspicuously present and alloyed with much more base matter, is almost everywhere. That the alloy is almost everywhere, also, is perfectly true. But, when we are asked whether soil is auriferous or not, we do not pause to inquire whether it is nothing but auriferous. It may be annoying enough to come, after such a passage, upon such another as this:—'Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wet-weather clothes, whip carefully chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody loafing on you, you loafing on somebody, headway, man before and man behind, good day's work, bad day's work, pet stock, mean stock, first out, last out, turning in at night.' But for what was the divine art of skipping created, if a reader is not able to dodge things like this, and to go straight to others which the theory of poetry (and of common sense) will allow?</p><p>We cannot, for our part, conceive any theory of poetry which shall shut out stuff such as the Death Carol, because it is not in any of 'the four-and-twenty measures,' as Welsh critics say, or because it finds itself in the company of unwise laudations of a (to speak mildly) imperfect state of politics and manners, unwise excursions into tacenda, unwise catalogues of names and trades, and other unwisdoms not a few.</p><p>No; let us, if it be ours to lecture on poetry, hold up Walt Whitman as much as any one pleases for an awful example of the fate that waits, and justly waits, on those who think (idle souls!) that there is such a thing as progress in poetry, and that because you have steam-engines and other things which Solomon and Sappho had not, you may, nay must, neglect the lessons of Sappho and Solomon. But let us none the less confess that this strayed reveller, this dubiously well-bred truant in poetry, is a poet still, and one of the remarkably few poets that his own country has produced.</p><p>∗ November Boughs. By Walt Whitman. London and Paisley: Gardner 1889.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S BOOK</p><p>———</p><p>A Striking Collection of Essays and Poems—A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads.</p><p>———</p><p>The Soul of Eastern Civilization—A Suggestive Work by Percival Lowell—Review of Minor Publications.</p><p>———</p><p>Walt Whitman.</strong></p><p>The time is past when Walt Whitman could be dismissed with a smile or a sneer, and he has already taken his place in the foremost rank of our writers. The public has been slow to recognize the power and value of his work, but no public, possessed of any degree of intelligence, could long hold out against the verdict rendered in his favor by the consensus of English and American critics. No writer of ordinary powers could win the approval and praise of such men (to name but a few) as Tennyson, Swinburne, W. M. Rossetti, J. A. Symonds and E. C. Stedman, and this praise and this approval have been bestowed by them in generous measure. It will appear then, at the present day, neither paradox nor extravagance to say that 'November Boughs' (Philadelphia: David McKay) is an important permanent contribution to American literature.</p><p>The contents of this suggestively named volume are diversified. There are some twenty pages of poems, half a dozen essays in literary criticism, several miscellaneous prose papers, and much fragmentary reminiscence of a varied and well-spent life. Of most interest, perhaps, is the 'Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads,' which serves as the volume's preface. In this admirable paper the veteran poet, with the objective vision of age, takes a long retrospective survey of his activities, admitting the reader more closely than before into the secret of his endeavor, and giving clear and forcible expression to the aims for whose accomplishment he has striven. 'At the age of 31 to 33,' he tell us, he found himself possessed by an overmastering impulse. 'This was a feeling or ambition to articulate and faithfully express in literary and poetic form, and uncompromisingly, my own physical, emotional, moral, intellectual and esthetic Personality, in the midst of, and tallying the momentous spirit and facts of its immediate days, and of current America—and to exploit that Personality, identified with place and date, in a far more candid and comprehensive sense than any hitherto poem or book.' The outcome of this ambition was the collection of pieces known collectively as 'Leaves of Grass' and the prose papers also put forth from time to time. 'The best comfort of the whole business is that, unstopp'd and unwarped by any influence outside the soul within me, I have had my say entirely my own way, and put it unerringly on record.' This is what he tells us, with a pride as pardonable as the occasion for its exhibition is rare even among writers of more than usual sincerity and earnestness of purpose. In another place the feeling of pride leads to this exclamation: 'My Book and I—what a period we have presumed to span! those thirty years from 1850 to 1880—and America in them! Proud, proud indeed may we be if we have culled enough of that period in its own spirit to worthily waft a few live breaths of it to the future!'</p><p>Upon the two matters in which Whitman's work has mainly given offence—its disregard respectively of the conventional requirements of morality and of literary form—this introduction is clear and outspoken. Concerning the latter of these matters we read: 'I know well enough, too, that in respect to pictorial talent, dramatic situations, and especially in verbal melody and all the conventional technique of poetry, not only the divine works, that to-day stand ahead in the world's reading, but dozens more, transcend (some of them immeasurably transcend) all I have done or could do. But it seemed to me, as the objects in Nature, the themes of estheticism, and all special exploitations of the mind and soul, involve not only their own inherent quality, but the quality, just as inherent and important, of their point of view, the time had come to reflect all themes and things, old and new, in the lights thrown on them by the advent of America and democracy—to chant those themes through the utterance of one not only the grateful and reverent legatee of the past, but the born child of the New World—to illustrate all through the genesis and ensemble of to-day; and that such illustration and ensemble are the chief demands of America's prospective imaginative literature.' While this plea may by no means be accepted as justifying Whitman's literary form, which has faults of which his defective sense does not allow him to dream, it is valuable as a statement of his aim in writing, and for its hearty recognition of the conventional types of excellence in literary composition. This recognition, indeed, finds further and ample expression in the papers on Tennyson, Burns and Shakspeare which are given in the present volume. Of the real purpose of literature, whether conventional or not in form, Whitman is substantially at one with all the great writers from Shakspeare downwards. 'I say the profoundest service that poems or any other writings can do for their reader is not merely to satisfy the intellect or supply something polished and interesting, nor even to depict great passions or persons and events, but to fill him with vigorous and clean manliness, religiousness, and give him good heart as a radical possession and habit.' These words are as noble as they are profoundly true.</p><p>The other matter, brought into prominence by the moralists, who have made themselves mainly responsible for the tardiness of the recognition bestowed upon Whitman's work, is thus met, and the opinion is enforced by years of careful reflection. 'From another point of view, 'Leaves of Grass' is avowedly the song of Sex and Amativeness, and even Animality—though meanings that do not usually go along with these words are behind all, and will duly emerge; and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and atmosphere. Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath of life to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been left unwritten were those lines omitted. Difficult as it will be, it has become, in my opinion, imperative to achieve a shifted attitude from superior men and women toward the thought and fact of sexuality as an element in character, personality, the emotions, and a theme in literature. I am not going to argue the question by itself; it does not stand by itself. . . . In respect to editions of 'Leaves of Grass' in time to come (if there should be such), I take occasion now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years, and I hereby prohibit, as far as word of mine can do, any elision of them.'</p><p>The few pages of poetry included within this volume should be reckoned with Whitman's most remarkable work. They exhibit, of course, the peculiarities of diction and the general formlessness of the 'Leaves of Grass.' The reader who is not prepared to accept the writer's theories, or, rather, who is not willing to acquiesce in them for the time being, will not be appealed to by these 'Sands at Seventy.' Admitting the peculiarities as a constant and consistent factor, there is much that is both striking and fine. Take, for example, this epigram on 'The Bravest Soldiers:'</p><p>'Brave, brave were the soldiers (high-named to-day) who lived through the night;<br>But the bravest press'd to the front and fell, unnamed, unkown.'</p><p>Here is a touch of nature that is admirable in its thought and feeling:</p><p>'Simple and fresh and fair from Winter's close emerging,<br>As if no artifice of fashion, business, politics, had ever been.<br>Forth from its sunny nook of shelter'd grass—innocent, golden, calm as the dawn,<br>The Spring's first dandelion shows its trustful face.'</p><p>The following fragment is based upon an incident of the Greely expedition—the hearing of a solitary snow-bird's song by the explorers in 83 degrees of north latitude:</p><p>'Of that blithe throat of thine from Arctic bleak and blank,<br>I'll mind the lesson, solitary bird—let me, too, welcome chilling drifts,<br>E'en the profoundest chill, as now—a torpid pulse, a brain unnerv'd,<br>Old age land-lock'd within its Winter bay—(cold, cold, O cold!)<br>These snowy hairs, my feeble arm, my frozen feet,<br>For them thy faith, thy role I take, and grave it to the last;<br>Not summer's zones alone—not chants of youth, or south's warm tides alone,<br>But held by sluggish toes, pack'd in the northern ice, the cumulus of years,<br>These with gay heart I also sing.'</p><p>There is something haunting about these lines, with whatever species of composition we may choose to class them, and this haunting quality appears upon every one of the too few pages which contain the poet's latest songs. At his best, Whitman has a genius for style and for apt expression of thought which allies him with the greater poets and insures for him the recognition and the respect of the future.</p><p>'November Boughs' is a title due to the same sense of literary fitness as that which inspired the naming of Landor's 'Dry Sticks' and 'The Last Fruit off an Old Tree.' Indeed, paradoxical as the statement may seem, a sense of fitness is the predominant impression remaining from the study of Whitman's work, and this in spite of its indefensible rhythmic and verbal vagaries. It is the fitness, in the large sense, of thought and language to the character and mood of the writer. 'Unstopp'd and unwarp'd by any influence outside the soul within me, I have had my say entirely my own way, and put it unerringly on record'—this is what Whitman tells us in the 'Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads' which prefaces the new volume. The absolute honesty of his work, coupled with the genius for style which it displays, ensure for it both permanence of influence and the respectful consideration of future years. Enlarge upon its faults as we may, the work still has rare qualities of power and beauty which it takes no extended search to discover. Let us quote the two poems entitled 'Halcyon Days' and 'Queries to my Seventieth Year.' He must be dull of soul who has no sense of the beauty of the one or the power of the other.</p><p>'Not from successful love alone,<br>Nor wealth, nor honor'd middle age, nor victories of <br>politics or war;<br>But as life wanes, and all the turbulent passions calm,<br>As gorgeous, vapory, silent hues cover the evening sky,<br>As softness, fulness, rest, suffuse the frame, like fresher, <br>balmier air,<br>As the days take on a mellower light, and the apple at <br>last hangs really finish'd and indolent-ripe on the <br>tree,<br>Then for the teeming quietest, happiest days of all!<br>The brooding and blissful halcyon days.'</p><p>It is the reverse of the shield that comes to view in the other poem:</p><p>'Approaching, nearing, curious,<br>Thou dim, uncertain spectre—bringest thou life or <br>death?<br>Strength, weakness, blindness, more paralysis and <br>heavier?<br>Or placid skies and sun? Wilt stir the waters yet?<br>Or haply cut me short for good? Or leave me here as <br>now,<br>Dull, parrot-like and old, with crack'd voice harping, <br>screeching?'</p><p>The poems in this volume fill but a score of pages, but every page has its charm. Upon one we find this faultless epigram on 'The Bravest Soldiers':</p><p>'Brave, brave were the soldiers (high named to-day) <br>who lived through the fight;<br>But the bravest press'd to the front and fell, unnamed, <br>unknown.'</p><p>Upon another we are greeted with this word for Lincoln's birthday:</p><p>'To-day, from each and all, a breath of prayer—a pulse <br>of thought,<br>To memory of Him—to birth of Him.'</p><p>Still another gives us this picture of the resurrection that comes with the springtide:</p><p>'Then shalt perceive the simple shows, the delicate <br>miracles of earth,<br>Dandelion, clover, the emerald grass, the early scents <br>and flowers,<br>The arbutus under foot, the willow's yellow-green, the <br>blossoming plum and cherry;<br>With these the robin, lark, and thrush, singing their<br> songs—the flitting bluebird;<br>For such the scenes the annual play brings on.'</p><p>We find verses like these, scattered in rich profusion through the songs:</p><p>'Possess'd by some strange spirit of fire.'</p><p>'With husky-haughty lips, O sea!<br>Where day and night I wend thy surf-beat shore.'</p>'Old age land-lock'd within its winter bay.'<p>'Isle of the salty shore, and breeze, and brine.'</p><p>It is the very magic of style that informs these lines. For the rest, these 'Sands at Seventy' contain no word that is objectionable as certain passages of the 'Leaves of Grass' were objectionable. Nor do we find in them the violent distortion of speech—the 'barbaric yawp,'—or the endless catalogues of attributes and things which made the poet's earlier work æsthetically offensive. Of the prose work which makes up the greater part of the volume, this is not the place to speak at length, and we will only remark that much of it seems to us as suggestive and beautiful as the poetry. The writer takes occasion, in his preface, to justify the passages in the 'Leaves of Grass' which have been the subject of so much discussion, and 'to confirm these lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years.'</p><p>[ . . .]</p><p><strong>'NOVEMBER BOUGHS.'</strong></p><p>A LARGE flat volume, strongly, roughly sewn and bound in russet-coloured limp cloth—Walt Whitman's November Boughs—comes over the sea. The author himself (as he expresses it) 'like a dismasted ship,' lying at Camden, New Jersey—occupying the brief remainder of his time, and the intervals of physical prostration and illness, with last editions of, and additions to, his works. ('Just now I am finishing a big volume of about 900 pages comprehending all my stuff, poems and prose.') When last I saw him—four years and a half ago—he was still able, with the aid of a stick or the arm of a friend, to enjoy a ramble through Camden and across the Ferry to Philadelphia, a fine-looking old man, through crippled somewhat in his gait by paralysis, well over six feet in height, with long white hair and beard, something elemental, haughty—the 'I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable' look about him, more developed even perhaps in age than when those words were written; withal an infinite tenderness and wistfulness in his eye—surely never in any man those two opposites, love and pride, exhibited side by side in such splendid antagonism as in him. Now he writes, 'Have not been out-doors for over six months—hardly out of my room, but get along better than you might think for'; his body disabled, and even at times his brain, but his great big heart seemingly the same as ever.</p><p>But to come to November Boughs. The book consists of 140 pp., clear but compact print, prose, and poetry; and to readers of Leaves of Grass and Specimen Days, forms a distinct, notable, and even important addition to both these volumes. The introductory essay is 'A backwards Glance o'er travel'd Roads,' and is really a history of the genesis and purpose of Leaves of Grass; the next twenty pages are occupied by poetical pieces, mostly short, under the general heading of Sands at Seventy; and the remainder of the book consists of short papers on a variety of subjects; a good many literary—Shakespeare, Burns, Tennyson, the Bible, etc.; notes on Father Taylor, Abraham Lincoln, Elias Hicks, George Fox; some more diary scraps; and a few remaining Memoranda of the War and the Hospitals. All these doubtless to be grouped with the earlier work under their different main headings in the complete volume which is to come.</p><p>Of Sands at Seventy, if, as the hour-glass runs out, the movement is a little slower and more laboured, still there is work here to be compared with the author's best: the same flat acceptance of ordinary facts, the same direct gaze into the spiritual world behind them; the same egotism; the same yearning, obstinately-clinging human love; the same unclipped jagged old lines; the same (though perhaps fewer) passages of large emotional volume. If there is a variation it is in the nearness of Death, and the many pieces and poems that embody the experiences of old age and the thoughts of the human creature in pretense of the unknown-to-come; and precious are these, for by how few have such subjects been treated with equal candour or with equal penetration!</p><p>'Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost,<br>No birth, identity, form—no object of the world.<br>Nor life, nor force, nor any visible thing;<br>Appearance must not foil, nor shifted sphere confuse thy brain.<br>Ample are time and space-ample the fields of Nature.<br>The body, sluggish, aged, cold-the embers left from earlier fires,<br>The light in the eye grown dim, shall duly flame again;<br>The sun now low in the west rises for mornings and for noons <br>continual;<br>To frozen clods ever the spring's invisible law returns,<br>With grass and flowers and summer fruits and corn.'</p><p>Or in 'A Carol closing Sixty-nine':—</p><p>'Of me myself—the jocund heart yet beating in my breast,<br>The body wreck'd, old, poor, and paralysed—the strange inertia<br>falling pall-like round me,<br>The burning fires down in my sluggish blood not yet extinct,<br>The undiminished faith—the group of loving friends.'</p><p>Yet the burden of it all is the same as of old in Leaves of Grass—'Pleasantly and well-suited I walk; wither I walk I cannot define, but I know that it is well.'</p><p>The Sands at Seventy are as variegated as ever. The poet resists anything better than his own diversity. Here is 'The first Dandelion' looking 'forth from its sunny nook of sheltered grass-innocent, golden, calm as the dawn'; here is a song to his Canary-bird; here is the 'small thin Indian helmsman, with brow elate and governing hand,' guiding the steamship through the dangerous rapids of the St. Lawrence; here is a picture of Broadway teeming with human life; here is the 'old salt,' Kossabone, related to the poet 'on his mother's side,' sits on a point overlooking the sea, watching, as his custom is, afternoons, the coming and going of the far vessels: he nearly ninety years old and a sailor all his life, now lives with his grandchild, Jenny:—</p><p>'And now the close of all:<br>One struggling outbound brig, one day, baffled for long—cross- <br>tides and much wrong going,<br>At last at nightfall strikes the breeze aright, her whole luck <br>veering,<br>And swiftly bending round the cape, the darkness proudly enter- <br>ing, cleaving, as he watches,<br>'She's free—she's on her destination'—these the last words- <br>when Jenny came, he sat there dead,<br>Dutch Kossabone, Old Salt, related on my mother's side, far back.'</p><p>Here is 'The Voice of the Rain,' very beautiful; and here, at last, most characteristic, most obstinately—clinging of all, is the Good-bye to his readers, entitled 'After the Supper and Talk':—</p><p>'After the supper and talk—after the day is done,<br>As a friend from friends his final withdrawal prolonging,<br>Good-bye and Good-bye with emotional lips repeating,<br>(So hard for his hand to release those hands—no more will they <br>meet,<br>No more for communion of sorrow and joy, of old and young,<br>A far-stretching journey awaits him, to return no more,)<br>Shunning, postponing severance—seeking to ward off the last <br>word ever so little,<br>E'en at the exit-door turning—charges superfluous calling back— <br>e'en as he descends the steps,<br>Something to eke out a minute additional—shadows of nightfall <br>deepening,<br>Farewells, messages lessening—dimmer the forthgoer's visage <br>and form,<br>Soon to be lost for aye in the darkness—loth, O so loth to depart!<br>Garrulous to the very last.'</p><p>One of the most interesting of the shorter papers is that 'On the Bible as Poetry.' Needless to say that Whitman—modern man though he essentially is—looks upon the Bible as a well-spring of poetry—'the axis of civilisation and history during thousands of years . . . . even to our Nineteenth Century here are the fountain-heads of song.' From him the chunk-headed 'secularist' gets scant regard; 'but reading folks probably get their information of those Bible areas and peoples, as depicted in print by English and French cads, the most shallow, impudent, supercilious brood on earth.'</p><p>Amid the Shakespeare speculations of the day, it is important to note that our author—who has undoubtedly a fine critical sense—leans slightly, though without by any means committing himself, to the Baconian theory; and more important, to find that he is convinced that the great series of historical plays hides within itself a deliberate plan and purpose—that, namely, of exposing the dragon-rancours of diseased and dying Feudalism—much, we suppose, as Ibsen's social dramas to-day are exposing the futilities of diseased and dying Commercialism.</p><p>An affectionate criticism of Robert Burns should commend the volume to the hearts of Scotchmen, though Whitman does not think those true friends of the Ayrshire bard who will not accept for him 'anything less than the highest rank, alongside of Homer, Shakespeare, etc.' A paper on 'Slang' is full of suggestion on that ever-wonderful topic, the growth of language. Another on 'The Old Bowery Theatre,' and Booth, the actor, is replete with local interest and reminiscences. But we must stop. The book is to be had for a dollar and a quarter (about 5s.) from David McKay, publisher, Philadelphia, and probably can be ordered through any British bookseller.</p><p>After all, November Boughs is just what its title suggests. The full foliage and wealth of summer has gone; but in exchange comes the widening prospect, the faint blue distance, the strangely-quickening odour of dead and dying leaves; the branches are alive with motion—the sough of the vast wind that sweeps over the world—the cosmic life—which, however impalpable, breathes through these pages. In one of his pieces in this volume Walt Whitman, apostrophising the Sea, declares that he would gladly surrender the powers of Homer and Shakespeare, if only the Sea would breathe upon his verse 'and leave its odor there.' And in another passage (in the introductory essay) he says—'No one will get at my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary performance, or attempt at such performance, or as aiming mainly towards art or æstheticism.' It is in this quality of Nature in Whitman's work, transcending Art, yet indeed only possible through the patient study, through the perfection and final surrender of Art, that the secret of Whitman's power lies. The breath of the free wind blows through his pages. Criticism of his imperfections is easy; the secret of his power is difficult to attain.</p><p>EDWARD CARPENTER.</p><p>November Boughs By WALT WHITMAN. Paisley and London: Alex. Gardner. 1889.</p><p>In this volume the author has gathered together a number of pieces both in prose and verse, written at different periods extending over a considerable number of years. The topics are varied, but chiefly of a literary, or biographical kind. There are poems entitled 'Sands at Seventy,' and others with the leading 'Fancies at Navesink.' Then there are prose essays, some of them covering little more than a page, and others extending to several pages on such topics Our Eminent Visitors, The Bible as Poetry, Burns as Poet and Person, Tennyson, Shakespeare, English Books, Slang in America, Abraham Lincoln, and a number of War Memoranda. But the most interesting as well as the most important of the Essays is the one with which the volume opens, 'A Backward Glance o'er Travell'd Roads.' In this the author reviews himself and his work, and notwithstanding all that has been said against his poetical beliefs and methods, reiterates his persuasion of their truth and appeals from the present to the future. Here also he repeats his demand that America should possess a literature peculiarly and exclusively its own, saying, 'No law or people or circumstances ever existed so needing a race of singers and poems differing from all others, and rigidly their own as the land and people and circumstances of our United States.' At the same time he restates his belief that science instead of superseding poetry will only open out fresh and more extensive fields to which the poetic imagination must emigrate. 'Whatever,' he remarks, 'may have been the case in years gone by, the true use for the imaginative faculty of modern times is to give ultimate vivification to facts, to science, and to common lives, endowing them with the glows and glories and final illustriousness which belong to every real thing, and to real things only.' The papers on Shakespeare and Burns are suggestive, but there is little new in them. On such subjects much that is new can scarcely be expected from anyone.</p>
