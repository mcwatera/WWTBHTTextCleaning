<p><em>Poems by Walt Whitman</em>. Selected and Edited by William Michael Rossetti London: John Camden Hotten. 1868.</p><p>Some years ago, when a few copies of a volume called Leaves of Grass found their way into this country from America, the general verdict of those who had an opportunity of examining the book was that much of it was indescribably filthy, most of it mere incoherent rhapsody, none of it what could be termed poetry in any sense of the word, and that, unless at the hands of some enterprising Holywell Street publisher, it had no chance of the honour of an English reprint. In part this opinion is already proved to have been a mistaken one, for a Westend publisher has taken compassion on the stranger, and now presents it to the British public in a comely form. It may be as well to state at the outset, that the volume published by Mr. Hotten is not precisely a reprint of the original Leaves of Grass. It contains much new matter written since the appearance of that work, and does not contain any of the pieces marked by that peculiar freedom of speech which is generally associated in men's minds with the name of Walt Whitman. For the sake of all parties, the prurient as well as the prudish, lest the one should be unnecessarily alarmed or the other led into an unremunerative venture, it is only fair to say that there is nothing in the present edition to disqualify it for decent society, not to say qualify it for a place in the Bibliothèque bleue . It has cost Mr. Rossetti severe pangs so he informs us, to part with so much as, from considerations of prudence, he has been obliged to exclude. 'This peculiarly nervous age,' this 'mealy-mouthed British nineteenth century,' with its present absurd notions about decency, morality, and propriety, could not be expected to receive 'the indecencies scattered through Whitman's writings,' in that æsthetic spirit in which they should be accepted; and, as he was unwilling to mutilate, 'the consequence is that the reader loses in toto several important poems, and some extremely fine ones—notably one of quite exceptional value and excellence, entitled, Walt Whitman.' In one respect we are willing to admit the loss sustained in this last instance. The 'poem' here referred to is the one which contains the key to Walt Whitman's philosophy and poetic theory. It is in it that he describes himself and his qualifications for the office of poet of the future, grounding his claim upon the fact of his being 'hankering, gross, mystical, nude, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshy, sensual, no more modest than immodest'; and proposing to produce poetry of corresponding qualities, a promise which we must say he most conscientiously fulfils. Its excellence may be open to question, but about its value to the reader who wishes to understand Walt Whitman there can be no doubt whatever.</p><p>The present edition is to be considered as an experiment. By excluding everything offensive, the editor hopes to induce people to reconsider the case of Walt Whitman, and reverse the verdict which has been already pronounced. This, we need scarcely observe, is rather more than they can be fairly asked to do, while the evidence which supports the gravest of charges brought against him is suppressed. But this is not all that Mr. Rossetti expects. The present selection is so to brace and fortify the British mind that in a short time, he trusts, it will be able to relish what now in its weakness it rejects. A complete edition of Walt Whitman, with all the dirt left in, he looks forward to as 'the right and crowning result' of his labours. This is but the school-boy's pudding, which, if we only finish it off, is to be succeeded by a full meal of the uncommonly strong meat he has in reserve for us. We must confess we should very much prefer to see Mr. Rossetti employing himself on some task more worthy of his abilities. He has on many occasions done good service as a critic to literature and art, but we cannot look upon his present enterprise as one in any way beneficial to either. He desires to have Walt Whitman recognized, not merely as a great poet, but as the founder of a new school of poetic literature which is to be greater and more powerful than any the world has yet seen. He is not, it is true, entirely alone in this attempt. There have been already certain indications of a Walt Whitman movement in one or two other quarters. More than a year ago there was a paper in the Fortnightly Review , which, however, was not so much a criticism of his poetry as of his person, the writer having had, as well as we recollect, the privilege of reviewing him as he bathed-an important advantage, certainly, in the case of a poet whose principal theme is his own body. Then Mr. Robert Buchanan took him up in the Broadway magazine, and, saying nearly all that has ever been said against Walt Whitman—that he is no poet and no artist, that he is gross, monotonous, loud, obscure, prone to coarse animalism and to talking rank nonsense—nevertheless arrived at pretty much the same conclusion as Mr. Rossetti, at least as to the powerful influence he is to exercise over the literature of the future. Something of this sort we might, indeed have expected. There are people whose reading of the Horatian saying about popular opinion is 'nunquam vulgus rectum videt,' and who always set themselves to find virtues in everything that is generally condemned. Besides, it would be idle to deny that Walt Whitman has many attractions for minds of a certain class. He is loud, swaggering, and self-assertive, and so gets credit for strength with those who worship nothing that is not strong. He is utterly lawless, and in consequence passes for being a great original genius. His produce is unlike anything else that has ever appeared in literature, and that is enough for those who are always on the look-out for novelty. He is rich in all those qualities of haziness, incoherence, and obscurity which seem to be the first that some readers nowadays look for in poetry. But, above all, he runs a muck with conventionalities and decencies of every sort, which naturally endears him to those silly people who take a childish delight in seeing the respectabilities of the world pulled by the nose, and what they consider its stupid prejudices shocked. We need scarcely say we do not suspect a man of Mr. Rossetti's taste and judgment of this kind of enthusiasm. If we were to hazard a theory, we should be inclined to attribute his advocacy of Walt Whitman's poetical claims to an impatience of the feebleness, emptiness, and sentimentality so abundant in modern poetry. The feeling is one with which we do not quarrel; we only object to the form in which it finds expression. A plague of tinkling cymbals is not to be met by a counter treatment of sounding brass.</p><p>An admirer of Walt Whitman has one immense advantage. There is no standard by which his idol can be measured, no known test which can be applied to prove his quality. There is, therefore, a wide field for that dogmatic assertion which is the favourite argument of the transcendental critic. You must not object that his poetry has no melody, music, or form. It is something above and beyond all requirements of that kind. You are not to raise the objection that in a great deal of what he writes there is no meaning at all, and in a great deal more the meaning, when got at, is utterly commonplace. Poetry like Walt Whitman's is not to be judged of by any one who is influenced by narrow considerations of meaning. You are not to take exception to his language, that it is a vile jargon of his own coining. A poet of this order naturally rises above the trammels of precedent in the matter of language. As to the absence of imagination, invention, fancy, art, and sundry other things more or less looked for in poetry, to complain of this in the present instance only shows that you are incapable of understanding the subject. This sort of argument always tells powerfully with the timid, with those people who are haunted by a nervous dread of being set down as dull and commonplace if they allow common sense to influence their judgment; and besides, it has the merit of being unanswerable, except by contradiction. When a man shows you something with all the outward and visible signs of a wheelbarrow, and tells you it is an Act of Parliament, it is very hard to know what to say to him; and it is just as hard to know what to say when you are offered something like the following and told it as poetry, and poetry of a very high order. As the admirers of Walt Whitman always protest against his being judged of fragmentarily, we take the shortest poem we can find, instead of giving the queerest extract:—</p><p><em>VISAGES.</em><br>Of the visages of things—And of piercing through to the accepted hells beneath.<br>Of ugliness—To me there is just as much in it as there is in beauty—And now the <br>ugliness of human beings is acceptable to me.<br>Of detected persons—To me, detected persons are not, in any respect, worse than <br>undetected persons—and are not in any respect worse than I am myself.<br>Of criminals—To me, any judge, or any juror, is equally criminal—and any reputa-<br>ble person is also-and the President is also.</p><p>Now it may be that this is not balderdash, though we must confess to a strong suspicion that it is; but if it is poetry, all we can say is, we must find some other word for Shakspeare. Walt Whitman himself is much more candid on this point than his advocates. He certainly declares himself to be a poet, but at the same time he describes the offspring of his muse as a 'barbaric yawp.' We have no very definite idea as to the precise nature of a yawp, but, whatever it may be, it can scarcely be poetry.</p><p>We must do Mr. Rossetti the justice of admitting that he does not entirely rely on dogmatism in pleading the cause of his protégé. He does assign some few reasons why Walt Whitman should be accepted as 'the poet of the epoch.' In a paper which appeared in a weekly journal, he puts the claim on the rather curious ground of his being 'an initiator in the scheme and structure of his writings, and an individual of audacious personal ascendant.' But in the preface to the present volume he comes more plainly to the point. The reader, he says, is not to ask himself, or return any answer to the questions, whether or not Walt Whitman is like other poets, or whether or not the particular application of rules of art which is found to hold good in the works of other poets, and to constitute a part of their excellence, can be traced also in his work. 'Let the questions rather be—Is he powerful? Is he American? Is he new? Is he rousing? Does he feel, and make me feel?' To each of these questions we should be disposed to answer simply 'No,' were it not that an unqualified negative is scarcely polite. We can see no reason for considering Walt Whitman powerful. Strong he may be, but it is only in the sense in which an onion is strong. His noise, bluster, and arrogance are no more indications of true strength than the swagger of the professional athlete at a country fair, who struts up and down the stage in salmon-coloured tights, and passes for a Hercules with the crowd from the way in which he feels his muscles in public. That he is American in one sense we must admit. He is something which no other country could have produced. He is American as certain forms of rowdyism and vulgarity, excrescences on American institutions, are American. But that he is American in the sense of being representative of American taste, intellect, or cultivation, we should be very sorry indeed to believe. New he certainly is, but it is only in his audacity, and in the abnormal structure of his poetry; there is not a new thought in his writings from beginning to end. As to the other questions, the answer must depend very much on individual temperament. Whether or not he himself feels we cannot tell, but, so far from being rousing or making his reader feel, we should say that with ninety-nine out of a hundred average readers Walt Whitman, taken in any quantity, would be found to be about as soporific a poet as ever produced a yawn. But even if all these questions could be answered in the affirmative—even if we were to concede that Walt Whitman is powerful and new and American and rousing, and throw into the bargain what his friends invariably lay great stress upon, his magnificent physique and his irreproachable character in private life—still all this, we submit, does not make him out to be a poet. To call a man a poet merely because he holds forth in rhapsodical style, about one man being as good as another, everything being all right, every one having a right 'to do as he dam pleases'—if we may venture to quote the concise language of Transatlantic liberty—and other dogmas of the same sort, is to confuse the functions of the poet and the stump orator; and generally, when Walt Whitman has any meaning at all, it amounts to no more than this. Very often he has no meaning whatever. In his fury he breaks out into a mere perspiration of words, and strings substantives together for pages on a stretch, the result being a something which is as much like poetry as an auctioneer's catalogue. To be sure there is scattered through his pages a vast amount of that vagueness which to some tastes has the true poetic charm. No doubt there are people who consider this sort of thing very fine:—</p><p><em>OF THE TERRIBLE DOUBT OF APPEARANCES.</em><br>The skies of day and night—colours, densities, forms—May-be these are (as doubt-<br>less they are) only apparitions, and the real something has yet to be known;<br>May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem) as from <br>my present point of view—And might prove (as of course they would) naught <br>of what they appear, or naught anyhow, from entirely changed points of view.</p><p>But if it is very fine, then so is Miss Codger's outburst on being introduced to Elijah Pogram:—</p><p>But why we call them so, or why impressed they are, or if impressed they are at all, or if at all we are, or if there really is, oh gasping one! a Pogram or a Hominy, or any active principle, to which we give those titles, is a topic, spirit-searching, light-abandoned, much too vast to enter on.</p><p>But of course the special charm of Walt Whitman is that he is so—what his admirers call—unconventional; that is, that he says things which other people do not say, and in language which other people do not generally use. His unconventionality, however, is of a very cheap sort. It is nothing more than the unconventionality of the man who considers clothes conventional, and goes about without them. It is true that for the present we are spared the bolder strokes of his genius in this respect, but, as has been already mentioned, it is only for the present; and besides, Walt Whitman's grossness is not accidental, but constitutional. It arises partly from an insensibility to the difference between that which is naturally offensive and that which is not, partly from his peculiar theory of poetry. As it is a fundamental principle of his to recognize no law of any kind, and to submit to no restrictions of artistic propriety, it follows that with him all subjects are equally fit for poetic treatment. As Mr. Rossetti puts it, 'he knows of no reason why what is universally seen and known, necessary and right, should not also be allowed and proclaimed in speech,' and it is just this ignorance of his which, independently of other reasons, makes any attempt to set him up as a poetic model mischievous to the interests of literary art. It is not a question of squeamishness or hyper-sensitiveness. There is no prudery in objecting to nastiness, nor is there any originality, honesty, manliness, or courage in obtruding what even instinct teaches us to avoid. We cannot say, however, that we anticipate any serious injury to English or American literature from the influence or popularity of Walt Whitman's poetry, so long at least as people are courageous enough to use their common sense, and do not allow themselves to be led away by transcendental 'high-falutin' into pretending an admiration which they do not feel.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.*</strong></p><p>THIS edition of Walt Whitman's poems has been specially prepared for the British public, is weeded of those pieces the occasional phraseology of which was found, in former instances, to shock many people, and contains specimens of every thing that is characteristic in the American poet's writings. Of pruned editions we have, generally speaking, an abhorrence; but in this case several chance expressions which Walt Whitman permitted himself were so very rude that his poems, as a whole, were deprived of that fair judgment which by rights belongs to every artistic work. Now we are far from considering Walt Whitman the merely blatant egotist which many English critics would have him to be; and we are glad that an opportunity presents itself to the ordinary English reader of estimating for himself the value of a writer who is almost new to us. Nor should we be surprised if the publication of this volume procure for its author a complete reversal of that vague opinion of him—founded almost entirely on hearsay—which has hitherto been current in this country. Walt Whitman is not an inflated Tupper. He is nebulous, mystical, sometimes incoherent, often laboriously 'distinct' without being 'clear'—according to Leibnitz's fine definition—but at no time does he fail to impress his reader with the sense that here is a man of power, a man capable of producing a definite impression on the mind. This is a result which never accrues from commonplace. Walt Whitman is, indeed, the Turner of poets. Sometimes you find a mere blurred mass of colour; then a piece of apparent commonplace; and then a picture which overawes the beholder. You may come to these studies with any mood of mind, and find it gratified. They will afford material for jokes; they will offer proof of the author's entire ignorance of or contempt for system and precedent; they will justify the wildest praise and the bitterest abuse. These are possibilities one does not find in commonplace; whatever the work is, it cannot be that. We have more than once seen the rather curious objection preferred against Walt Whitman, that the impression he produced on his admirers is simply owing to his talking largely and being incomprehensible. That, however, is a form of literature which so many modern writers have made us familiar, that every reader can at once deny the fact of any impression being produced by such easy authorship beyond that of insufferable weariness. The ordinary graces of poetry are not to be found in these poems. They are, as we have said, without system or precedent; the utterances of a man with an amazing belief, not in himself as an individual, but in himself as a spokesman of a new country and a new time.</p><p>'And I too of the Manahatta, singing thereof <br>—and no less in myself than the whole<br> of the Manahatta in itself.'</p><p>Neither the dreams of Novalis nor the later speculations of Faraday are to be compared with that insistence of the mystic transmutation of spirit which this realistic and democratic poet sings. He does not worship the body, and passions, and infirmities of Walt Whitman; he worships these as all that he knows of humanity; and this is strikingly exemplified in a poem which has, unfortunately, but necessarily been omitted from the present edition. He seems to lose in his own mind all sense of the difference between the individual and the mass:—</p><p>'All architecture is what you do to it when <br>you look upon it;<br>Did you think it was in the white or grey <br>stone? or the lines of the arches and <br>cornices?<br>All music is what awakes from you <em>when you <br>are reminded by the instruments.'</em></p><p>Anthropomorphism of a subtle and indefinite kind seems to be his principle theme; an anthropomorphism, however, differing widely from that of the sensationalists. According to him, 'objects gross and the unseen Soul are one;' while as to spiritual creations:—</p><p>'We consider bibles and religions divine—I <br>do not say they are not divine;<br>I say they have all grown out of you, and <br>may grow out of you still;<br>It is not they who give the life—it is you <br>who give the life;<br>Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or <br>trees from the earth, than they are shed <br>out of you.'</p><p>As a specimen of what may be called his 'prophetic manner,' take the following striking passage, full of a shadowy, but real and impressive force:—</p><p>'What whispers are these, O lands, running <br>ahead of you, passing under the seas?<br>Are all nations communing? Is there go-<br>ing to be but one heart to the globe?<br>Is humanity forming en masse? —for lo! <br>tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim;<br>The earth, restive, confronts a new era, per-<br>haps a general divine war;<br>No one knows what will happen next—such <br>portents fill the days and nights.<br>Years prophetical! the space ahead, as I <br>walk, as I vainly try to pierce it, is full <br>of phantoms;<br>Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their <br>shapes around me;<br>This incredible rush and heat—this strange <br>ecstatic fever of dreams, O years!<br>Your dreams, O years, how they penetrate <br>through me! (I know not whether I <br>sleep or wake!)<br>The performed America and Europe grow <br>dim, retiring in shadow behind me;<br>The unperformed, more gigantic than ever, <br>advance, advance upon me.'</p><p>Such is the cumbrous and ungainly 'method' of Walt Whitman's utterance; and that again is not unfrequently rendered more forbidding by an unnecessary diffuseness and what seems to us to be an intentional vagueness. That the writer of these poems—if poems they are to be called—is worthy of greater attention than has yet been paid him in England, we endeavored to show in a former article. For him, as for any other writer, we would bespeak a patient hearing. The material which he offers us is so novel and so bold, that we are ready to distrust any immediate critical estimate, and would fain see Walt Whitman pass into the crucible of popular reading. Mr. Rossetti, we think, has done his editorial work—in this case rendered peculiarly difficult—well; and we recommend the reader to pay careful attention to Mr. Rossetti's appreciate[ve] and yet impartial judgment of Whitman in the preface to the book. We should have preferred to the engraved portrait of Walt Whitman in the present volume a copy of the striking and picturesque photo of him lately taken in New York; but even the former will give the English reader some slight indication of the poet's features and expression. In other respects the edition is nicely got up; and we have no hesitation in commending it as an excellent index to the writings of a man who cannot be overlooked.</p><p>———</p><p>∗ Poems by Walt Whitman. Selected and Edited by W.M. Rossetti London: John Camden Hotten.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.—SECOND NOTICE.*</p><p>———</p></strong><p>Somewhat more than a year ago (vide Sunday Times, March 3rd, 1867) we called the attention of our readers to the works of an American poet—Walt Whitman—at that moment all but unknown in England. While admitting all that was wild, disorderly, and extravagant in these writings, we did justice to the many high qualities they possessed, spoke of them as the most thoroughly national and characteristic poetry to which America had yet given birth, and anticipated for them, when the first feelings of dislike, which the violation of all received models had occasioned were repressed, a large measure of regard among the more cultivated classes of English readers. At the time we wrote, the volume containing Whitman's poems was one of the rarest in England. A few scattered copies could be found, belonging principally to those who had received the work in their capacity of reviewers. We spoke warmly of the desirability of placing it within the reach of a certain tolerably extensive class of readers, and discussed the feasibility of an English reprint. Sooner than we anticipated has such reprint come. It has taken, moreover, the form we expected a first edition of Whitman to bear;—a form not in itself attractive to scholars and students, but such as in the present case was alone to be expected, and such as the exceeding taste of the editor has rendered as little offensive as possible to the haters of expurgated editions. Many motives induce us to recur for a brief while to the works of Whitman, to do which the appearance of the first English edition affords a favourable opportunity. Enough has not yet been said about the man, and the edition itself is a novelty in English literature, deserving on its own account a few words of comment. Not, however, in the few phrases that follow, nor in many more, for which we have not space, should we hope to do justice to that remarkable kosmos, Walt Whitman. He is not a man to be easily dismissed. A few glibly-spoken phrases will not describe him or his work. His faults and excellences are of the kind least commonly encountered, and have phases enough to render just and satisfactory criticism a task of more than usual difficulty. Walt Whitman is undoubtedly a great man. His position as a poet is not likely to be conceded without much dispute. Conservatives in poetry will shrink from utterances which appear to defy all known canons, and possess scarcely one of the gifts hitherto judged indispensable to verse. Unreflective readers will see nothing but a harsh and over-daring Tupper. Those even, whose sympathies are broad, and who shrink from subjecting all poetry to the tape, may pause ere they bestow the title of verse on these strong and often inharmonious outpourings. But no thinking reader will dispute that he is in the presence of a man and a thinker. Whitman is entitled to rank with those men whose works are the scholar's especial delight. His mind is of the same order with that of Rabelais or Montaigne. Rightly to understand him, however, it is necessary to transport oneself in idea from the over-crowded and, in one sense, over-civilised world of Europe, to the great continent whose first seer he is. American life and institutions have impregnated Whitman's soul. American air has saturated his lungs. He knows nothing of old-world notions and conventions; laughs at them when he hears of them, or passes them by as things unworthy of a thought. He is an American, Manhattanese, a democrat. The world he lives in is untroubled with questions of kingcraft or priestcraft. Human nature, in the manifold developments which in its fight in city or backwood it assumes, he knows and loves. Comradeship is his motto. Men who work and love like he are his brothers. The question of success never enters into his calculations. He sings forgotten or unknown heroes as soon as those whose names are foremost in the scroll of fame. The imperfections of the human nature he contemplates are as well worthy of study as its perfections. Nothing about manhood is vile or unclean. His contempt for the assumptions of philosophy is not greater nor less than his disregard of the dogmatism of authority. He is the most pantheistic of pantheists. The God he worships reveals himself in all places, even where Egyptian or Phoenician would not have sought him. The divine in the human he understands and worships. Nothing with Whitman is unfit for the uses of poetry. Mr. Buchanan is not more ready to descend for the subject of his poetry to street or slum. Wordsworth is not more enraptured of solitude, or in closer communion with nature. His principal theme is, however, manhood; first, as he sees it in the individual that is himself, next as he sees it in the world at large, the American world that is. 'Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the muse: I say the form complete is worthier far. The female equally with the male, I sing.' His book is, as Mr. Rossetti admirably observes, the poem of personality and democracy. It is strong, passionate, rhapsodical even, and yet pervaded with matter-of-fact plainness of speech. It is extravagant at times both in reality and ideality. One thing, at least, it never is—unhealthy or morbid. The edition of Whitman's poems which Mr. Rossetti has published does not pretend to completeness. It is but a book of extracts. In its class, however, it is a model. Never before has the public had a volume of extracts in which it might depend with greater confidence upon the taste of him who chose. Our own dislike to selections is not greater than that which Mr. Rossetti proclaims. If, however, there are books of which one should know much while one cannot afford him to know all, we should like always to have Mr. Rossetti to taste and select for us. Mr. Rossetti announces his volume as intended rather to herald the entire work than to render it unnecessary. He has felt it expedient to give the public some knowledge of the first truly national poet America has produced, and has determined not to frighten away the general reader by printing the poems in which the writer flies in the face of prejudices entertained by a large portion of Englishmen. But Mr. Rossetti is no Bowdler. He has given us many poems entire. Others he has entirely omitted. This we at once admit is the only principle upon which work of this kind can be done, and yet find favour with thoughtful readers. Into the question of the value of English prejudice Mr. Rossetti does not enter. His few remarks are explanatory of his motives, neither deprecatory nor justificatory. The greatest works of all times, from the earliest literature of Greek and Hebrew, to the latest of France and England, are offensive to English prudery. He has given to the English world those writings of a great and unknown writer, which it may read without being shocked. If after reading these the public wants more, and cares to risk the chance of being shocked, it can obtain them. That is its own affair. Only in the preface to the first edition of Leaves of Grass, which Mr. Rossetti has most judiciously included in his volume, are one or two passages left out, and these he had the author's permission to omit. For it is a fact, creditable alike to editor and publisher, that this work is published with the express sanction of the author, who will receive a royalty on every copy sold, and who has accorded liberty for the sale of the volume in America, wherein at present the earlier editions of Whitman are scarce and expensive. In Mr. Rossetti's preface—a model of grave thoughtful criticism, and free and elegant English—we have a few particulars of Whitman's biography; a description of his personal appearance, and an account of the reception which attended the first publication of his works in America. Some account is also given of his heroic conduct during the late war. The remainder is composed of criticisms upon Whitman's works, and an explanation of the theory of his workmanship. A portrait of the author, very admirably engraven, accompanies the volume, which is unusually elegant and attractive in appearance. In our previous account of Whitman, to which the present notice is intended as an appendix, we quoted as liberally from the published works as our space would permit. We are now, accordingly, exonerated from the necessity of supporting by extracts the opinions we have pronounced. We regret that we cannot quote one passage from the prose preface of which we have spoken. The whole of the preface is wonderfully powerful, sonorous, and trumpet-like, and is in itself sufficient to render, a desirable possession the volume in which it appears. As an exposition of Whitman's views of art it is profoundly interesting. We trust that now that Whitman's works are easily accessible, few Englishmen will care to leave them unread. For ourselves, we confess to sharing the opinion eloquently expressed by his English editor, 'His voice will one day be potential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken—that is to say, in the four corners of the earth; and in his own American hemisphere the uttermost orators of democracy will confess him not more their announcer than their inspirer.'</p><p>∗ <em>Poems of Walt Whitman</em>. Selected and edited by William Michael Rossetti <em>John Camden Hotten.</em></p><p><strong>Walt Whitman's Poems.</strong></p><p><em>Poems by Walt Whitman</em>. Selected and Edited by William Michael Rossetti One Vol., pp. 406. J.C. Hotten.</p><p>Opening this book has been to us a revelation. Reading it has yielded us exquisite pleasure. The remembrance of it sweetens life. Echoes from it haunt us in the thick of our occupations, 'under the shade of melancholy boughs,' in the throng of the streets, at our meals, in the midst of our conversations, anywhere, everywhere, under the likeliest and the unlikeliest circumstances. Before the volume now under notice came into our hands, the name of Walt Whitman was certainly known to us, but that was all. Now that we have read these selections—observe, these selections—from his 'Chants Democratic,' from his Drum Taps, from his Leaves of Grass, from his 'Songs of Parting,' we have learnt to love that name of his, it has become to us a synonym of pleasure, suggestive of thoughts, emotions, aspirations, expressed as in a new language, and, once so expressed, never afterwards to be altogether forgotten. To William Michael Rossetti, as the selecter of these poems, we are not simply, in old-fashioned phrase, beholden, we are not merely in courtlier terms his most obedient, we are his very gratefully, and that, moreover, in heartfelt truthfulness. Already in the columns of the clever but now dead and gone Chronicle, under date 6th July, 1867, the editor of this henceforth to us cherished volume of Walt Whitman's Poems had sounded the trumpet of admiration in praise of that particular poet of America. Here, however, he has made good, in every sense, his high, and, as it might have seemed to some, extravagant commendations. Of the justice of the estimate thus enunciated, these poems yield absolute demonstration. Apart from the selection now given to us by Mr Rossetti, we are desirous that it should be understood at once, however, by our readers, that we know nothing whatever of the writings of Walt Whitman. This we would especially premise. And for a sufficient reason. According to a very general rumour even over here in England, according to the showing of even so enthusiastic an appreciator of his genius as Mr Rossetti has (happily for us all) shown himself to be—Walt Whitman has written things that his own most ardent admirers would willingly let die. Yet, of all this, the volume now in our hand, here submitted to our consideration, bears not a particle of evidence. The leering satyrs have been scared away from among the beautiful umbrage. The dregs lurk no longer in the limpid draught placed at our lips. We can quaff without a qualm. There is no canker in the rose-wreath as it is thus brought within our reach—it is all fragrance and dripping with dew. Not a taint is here, in bloom, or foliage, or fruit. The very atmosphere investing these poems is all purity, like the breath of morning. And yet—though we never should have conjectured as much from these poems themselves—the Collective Writings of Walt Whitman must indubitably be tainted, flawed, polluted—and that, too, with a taint, a flaw, a pollution in no conceivable way to be extenuated. Mr Rossetti himself sets forth in regard to the incriminated poems (all of which he has carefully omitted in the process of making his selection) not one word, not one hint of extenuation. He says, indeed, that he considers 'that most of them would be much better away.' And, whatever else can be said of the editor of the present volume as a critic of poetic literature, it certainly cannot be said of him that he is a purist. 'Indecencies, improprieties, deforming erudities' there are, he tells us, scattered, it may even be abundantly scattered, here and there, over the Writings of Walt Whitman. Such they are acknowledged to be, in so many words, even by the critic thanks to whose judicious hands those damning blemishes have been discarded. Of their existence at all, we only know, now, by their own evil reputation. They themselves are not here. Nevertheless this selection is in no respect what we should call, in the ordinary acceptation of the words, an Expurgated Edition. There is here no emasculation. The poems that are given are given in their entirety. Mere parts have been nowhere selected. Abbreviations, elisions, excisions, the Editor has shrunk from as from impertinences. He has done his task well and wisely. And yet, task it can hardly be called—true labour of love as it has been (and no wonder) throughout. Although containing within it 'a little less,' we are told 'that [sic] half the entire bulk of Whitman's poetry,' this one volume affords a comprehensive view of the writer's genius in its integrity. It is no broken gem that is here placed in our hands for examination, but—'one entire and perfect chrysolite.' Before commenting upon Walt Whitman's poetical productions, however, so far as those are here brought within our survey, a word or two as to the man himself. Abraham Lincoln's exclamation on seeing him was—'Well, he looks like a man!' Nor can that exclamation be wondered at when one comes to sum up his characteristics. Lofty in stature, admirably well proportioned, of vigorous strength, of abounding health—forty-nine years of age on the last day of next month—his eyes of a light blue, his complexion florid, his beard fleecy and flowing, but already quite grey—cheerful and masculine in appearance—having a predilection for the society of common people—intensely fond of fine music, and with a great natural taste for works of art—absolutely indifferent 'as to either praise or blame of what he writes'—such, in brief, is Walt Whitman. Born on the 31st of May, 1819, at the farm village of West Hills, Long Island, in the state of New York, somewhere about thirty miles from the great American capital and outport—he is but now in the prime or meridian of his manhood, though already old-looking in spite of his health, of his wholesome out-door life, his temperate habits, and his vigorous constitution. A schoolboy up to thirteen, afterwards a compositor, then a country teacher, then a press writer, then a newspaper editor, then a master printer, then (like his father) a carpenter and builder, then, throughout the Great Civil War, to the Northern Army, what Miss Nightingale was to the British Army at Scutari throughout the War in the Crimea. And, yet all along, and at last wholly and solely, what he is now for the rest of his days—a Poet. Before considering him as such, it is but justice to remark of him in his capacity as a practical philanthropist when attending the poor soldiers all through that tremendous struggle between North and South, between the Federals and the Confederates in America, that 'It is said that by the end of the war he had personally ministered to upwards of 100,000 sick and wounded.' Honour, therefore, to the brave, true heart, if only in remembrance of that one recorded fact in his history—a fact evidencing that Walt Whitman not only 'looks' but acts 'like a man.' Turning our glance, however, from the man himself to his productions, to those Poems of his which have been here selected for us from his 'Songs of Parting,' his Leaves of Grass, his Drum Taps, and so on—one peculiarity is at once especially noticeable in regard to them, and that is their startling, intense, and absolute originality. In their manner, they are unlike any other poems that have ever previously made their appearance. As a rule, they are rhymeless. But, always, always they are rhythmical, and yet rhythmical after a manner peculiarly and exceptionally their own. The lines are of any length—sometimes abbreviated to a little more than a monosyllable—occasionally running out to the extent of half-a-dozen alexandrines. Now standing, as one might say, on one foot, and that a-tip-toe—now running along upon as many feet as those of a centipede. But—with all this whimsicality and abandon of manner, with all this wild defiance of the hitherto dominant laws of poetical, and, for that matter even at times of rhetorical, construction—O the charm, the grace, the tenderness, the pathos, the abounding and captivating beauties scattered broadcast, with a lavish hand, with an affluent fancy, with the royal prodigality of genius, over these pages of true poetry! Nor can the daring originality thus manifested by Walt Whitman in the mere manner of his composition be regarded as so wholly unexampled. As has been admirably well asked—</p><p>'Was genius awed by Aristotle's rules<br>When Shakspeare burst the cobwebs of the schools?'</p><p>Flinging to the winds of heaven all the precedents of literature, this new poet of the New World, a poet intensely sui generis, one racy of the soil from which he has sprung, carves out his own way with a pen as trenchant as an axe, and goes upon that way of his rejoicing. About the only one rhymed passage in the whole of this otherwise quite rhymeless volume of poetry, is the opening of the song in celebration of the broad-axe in the 'Chants Democratic.' And, having but just now—in total forgetfulness at the moment, alike of that especial passage and of that particular song—likened Walt Whitman's pen, in the trenchant sweep of it, to an axe, such as it might be seen gleaming and crashing when wielded in the grip of a backwoodsman of thews and sinews like his own—upon our sudden remembrance immediately afterwards of his own words, the simile appears more than ever most appropriate. For, thus it is that Walt Whitman, in his 'Song of the Broad Axe,' apostrophises that—</p><p>'Weapon, shapely, naked, wan;<br>Head from the mother's bowels drawn!<br>Wooded flesh and metal bone; limb only one,<br> and lip only one!<br>Grey-blue leaf by red-heat grown! helve<br> produced from a light seed sown!<br>Resting the grass amid and upon,<br>To be leaned, and to lean on.'</p><p>A pen no less potent, keen, piercing, than such a broad axe, 'to be leaned and to lean on,' resting the grass [Leaves of Grass] amid and upon'—is, most assuredly, for us the pen of Walt Whitman. Otherwise than in one fragmentary instance like the foregoing, the book is, as we have said, altogether rhymeless. Wonderfully rhythmical throughout, though in lines of the most oddly varying lengths, the poems of Walt Whitman—when the reader has once passed the Rubicon—exercise over that initiated reader's mind a potent and irresistible fascination. The Rubicon must be passed, however, as a preliminary, as the first and all-essential preliminary of initiation. Meaning by that, simply, that any one coming to the examination of Walt Whitman's poems with a view to their complete appreciation, must begin by, we won't say taking this and that for granted, we won't even say by making such and such allowances, for, so expressing ourselves, we might seem to be slighting the high inherent claims to respect of a great original writer, such as Walt Whitman: instead of that we will say then simply—that the all-essential preliminary we are alluding to is one purely of concession. Concede to Whitman the fashion of his verse—concede to him his terse but never bald realism—concede to him his exotic verbiage, his coinage of words occasionally, with a daring disregard alike of the laws of syntax and of philology—and the spell of the magician is felt at once and for ever! We are within the circle of his poetic incantations! He 'hath his will' thenceforth—as he lists—at his own pleasure over our hearts, our emotions, our imaginations. As exemplars, to begin with, of his magical power in mere word-painting—take almost haphazard a single line or verse picked out here and there from the midst of his descriptions:—</p><p>'Evening—me in my room—the setting sun,<br>The setting summer sun shining in my open windows, <br>showing the swarm of flies, suspended, balancing <br>in the air in the centre of the room, darting athwart, <br>up and down, casting swift shadows in specks on <br>the opposite wall, where the shine is.'</p><p>'The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves, after <br>the storm is lulled.'</p><p>'Me observing the spiral flight of two little yellow <br>butterflies shuffling between each other, ascending <br>high in the air.</p><p>'And the fish suspending themselves below there—and <br>the beautiful curious liquid.'</p><p>'In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, <br>with a wind-dapple here and there.'</p><p>These word paintings of Whitman's sometimes pass by their very vividness into whimsicalities, yet are, for all that, wondrous word-paintings nevertheless: as where he speaks of—</p><p>' . . .dabs of music;<br>Fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of <br>the great organ.'</p><p>His word-painting power goes with him everywhere. Into the ship-building yard, for example, where we see with him, as if we, too, were there—</p><p>'The butter-coloured chips flying off in great flakes, <br>and slivers.</p><p>It goes with him, and we with it and with him through even the swinging of a door—</p><p>'The door passing the dissevered friend, flushed <br>and in haste.</p><p>Sometimes the secret of it lies even in a word—</p><p>'The dim-lit church and the shuddering organ .'</p><p>Or, again, as where conjuring up shapes before him in his reverie, he speaks, among others, of—</p><p>'The shape of the shamed and angry stairs, trod by<br> sneaking footsteps.</p><p>Or, yet more even, where brooding over many exquisite imaginings, he says most oddly and whimsically—</p><p>'They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.'</p><p>Or, again in the same way, when, by one subtle word, we note the last agonised kiss of bereaved affection, when—</p><p>'The <em>twitching</em> lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying.'</p><p>The merest specks and atoms of beauty, however, are these little word-pictures noticeable in casual lines and phrases in Walt Whitman's poetry. Immeasurably more noteworthy are the large humanity and the wide philosophy evidenced and inculcated by his utterances. His cry is that of Happiness and of Adoration—</p><p>'For I do not see one imperfection in the universe.'</p><p>Another while he declares—</p><p>'That all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, <br>each as profound as any.'</p><p>And another while he ejaculates:—</p><p>'The sun and stars that float in the open air;<br>The apple-shaped earth and we upon it—surely the drift <br>of them is something grand!'</p><p>Adding—</p><p>'I do not know what it is, except that it is grand, and <br>that it is happiness.'</p><p>Again, he is full of wonderment at the abounding wonders around him, among others at—</p><p>'The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and <br>the wonders that fill each minute of time forever.'</p><p>The wonder of wonders to him, however—the glory and consolation of his life—(the enunciation of which, of the joy and solace of which to fellow mortals, is among the most dearly-cherished aspirations of his ambition)—the one great end worth living for, being, according to Walt Whitman—Death. Thus he exclaims—</p><p>'And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it<br> may be turned to beautiful results—and I will show <br>that nothing can happen more beautiful than death.</p><p>It is thus that he speaks in his 'Song at Sunset' of—'the superb vistas of Death.' It is thus that in his poem addressed 'To one Shortly to Die,' he closes it not in pity but in felicitation—</p><p>'I do not commiserate—I congratulate you.'</p><p>It is thus he sings exultantly—</p><p>'I shall go with the rest.<br>We cannot be stopped at a given point—that is no satis-<br>faction,<br>To show us a good thing, or a few good things, for a space <br>of time—that is no satisfaction;<br>We must have the indestructible breed of the best, regard-<br>less of time.<br>If otherwise, all these things come but to ashes of dung<br>If maggots and rats ended us, then alarum! for we are <br>betrayed!<br>Then indeed suspicion of death.<br>Do you suspect death? If I were to suspect death I should <br>die now:<br>Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well suited to-<br>ward annihilation?'</p><p>Consonant with his rapturous exultation in the thought of Death, consonant with his homage for the perfection of the universe, are his absolute confidence in the reality of the future, and his profound sense that all that is holiest has never yet in any way been adequately realised or appreciated:—</p><p>'I say the whole earth, and all the stars in the sky, are<br> for religion's sake.<br>I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough,<br>None has ever yet adored or worshipped half enough;<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, <br>and how certain the future is.'</p><p>Hence he sings, hence he is a Poet, hence he undertakes in these poems of his to write the 'evangel-poem of comrades and love.' Akin to his overflowing delight in the thought of the Now and the Hereafter, are the largeness and the depth, the exquisite self-abnegation and the all-embracing comprehensiveness of his humanity. To the very dregs and scum and squalor of the evil streets of a bad city he cries out—by a subtle violation of grammar, as it seems to us, i.e., in the verb we have italicised in the subjoined quotation, appealing to them as though he spoke with them from their own level—</p><p>'Because you are greasy and pimpled, or that you was <br>drunk, or a thief,<br>Or diseased, or rheumatic, or a prostitute, or are so now,<br>Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar, <br>and never saw your name in print,<br>Do you give in that you are any less immortal?'</p><p>At the City Dead House in his 'Leaves of Grass,' we see him standing—gazing—yearning, in tenderest pity and commiseration over—what? over 'an outcast form,' indeed, over the body of a poor dead prostitute—</p><p>'The divine woman, her body—I see her body—I look on <br>it alone,<br>That house, once full of passion and beauty—all else I <br>notice not;<br>No stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor <br>odours morbific impress me;<br>But the house alone—that wondrous house—that delicate <br>fair house—that ruin!<br>That immortal house, more than all the rows of dwellings <br>ever built,<br>Or white domed Capitol itself, with majestic figure sur-<br>mounted—or all the old high-spired cathedrals,<br>That little house alone more than them all—poor desperate <br>house!<br>Fair, fearful work! tenement of a Soul! itself a Soul!<br>Unclaimed, avoided house! take one breath from my <br>tremulous lips;<br>Take one tear, dropped aside as I go, for thought of you,<br>Dead house of love! house of madness and sin, crumbled! <br>crushed!<br>House of life—ere while talking and laughing—but, oh, <br>poor house! dead even then;<br>Months, years, an echoing, garnished house—but dead <br>dead, dead.'</p><p>So wide, so profound, so insatiable are the yearnings of this great heart for sympathy, that on turning to his poem on 'Envy' what do we find to be the cause of his Envy? Not a perusal of the records of heroism, not the thought of Mighty Generals or Men in Power, but—when he reads of the brotherhood of lovers—</p><p>'How through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, <br>long and long,<br>Through youth, and through middle and through old age, <br>how unfaltering, how affectionate, and faithful they <br>were,<br>Then I am pensive—I hastily put down the book, and <br>walk away, filled with the bitterest envy.'</p><p>In illustration of the same thought, or rather of the same tender, yearning for sympathy, read his commemoration of 'Parting Friends,'—</p><p>'Two simple men I saw to-day on the pier, in the midst <br>of the crowd parting the parting of dear friends;<br>The one to remain hung on the other's neck and pas-<br>sionately kissed him,<br>Whilst the one to depart tightly pressed the one to re-<br>main in his arms.'</p><p>Or, still more, the Poet's apostrophe 'To a Stranger':—</p><p>'Passing stranger! you do not know how longingly I look <br>upon you.'</p><p>Most of all this yearning for sympathy shines forth when it is recognised 'Among the Multitude;' when, in other words, the Poet foresees it, thus—</p><p>'Among the men and women, the multitude<br>I perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs,<br>Acknowledging none else—not parent, wife, husband, <br>brother, child, any nearer than I am:<br>Some are baffled—But that one is not—that one knows <br>me.<br>Ah! lover and perfect equal!<br>I meant that you should discover me so, by my faint <br>indirections;<br>And I, when I meet you, mean to discover you by the <br>like in you.'</p><p>So, too, he sees them afar off in foreign lands, those breasts with whom his own could sympathise could they be brought into communion:—</p><p>'O I know we should be brethren and lovers—<br>I know I should be happy with them.'</p><p>It were idle, however, attempting to afford the reader any adequate notion of these poems as a symmetrical whole, through mere fragmentary or incidental quotations like those to which a reviewer is necessarily restricted. It would be worse than the proffering of the specimen-brick by the house-vendor in Hierocles—it would be the production of a handful of splinters chipped off the Apollo Belvidere, or of a stray finger torn from the Venus de Medici. Whitman's Poems—as is the case with every true work of art—must be viewed each in its entirety before there can be any hope whatever of their accurate appreciation. So regarded, they cannot fail by any possibility, as we conceive, to win the admiration to which they are so signally entitled. After this fashion alone—that is to say at once, searchingly and comprehensively—ought at any time to be examined, that noble apostrophe, beginning at page 310, To Death, that profound and heart-penetrating epitome of Human Life, commencing at page 356, that no less effective and affecting poem upon Night and Death which opens at page 266, but above all the magnificent Nocturn upon the Death of President Lincoln beginning at page 301, and, what is to our mind even finer than that, the exquisitely pathetic and pre-eminently beautiful celebration by Walt Whitman of the first revelation to himself of his own powers and future path in life as a poet, when, as a little barefooted child, he stood upon the sea-shore one evening and far on into the night, listening to the lamentations of the song-bird bereaved of its mate, himself drowned in tears as he listened—standing, there, entranced in the moonlight drinking in the music of that delicate and tender death-chant! Never before was the song of a bird so put into human language—never before was the rapturous anguish of the poetic summons so articulated. It is Béranger's Ma Vocation repeated: when—speaking of himself as a mere infant—the old Chansonnier sings to us—</p><p>'Une plainte touchante,<br>De ma bouche sortit;<br>Le bon Dieu me dit: Chante,<br>Chante, pauvre petit.'</p><p>And now that Whitman has sung (and is still, for that matter, happily singing in the midst of us) in obedience to the holy mandate by which every true poet is at the outset made aware of his vocation, he has as profound a sense of the reality of that summons, and of the consequent permanence or security of his reputation as a Poet, as ever Horace had when proudly forecasting his own poetic immortality. Assuming to himself at once his right position in English Literature, he has even, as it happens, like almost all the more remarkable poets in our language, selected, unconsciously it may be, but unmistakably his own special emblem! Henceforth, as it seems to us, his inalienably and no other's! A floral emblem to be worn by him from this time forth as conspicuously as the sprig of bloom fastened of old on the helmet of the first Plantaganet. In this, as we have just now intimated, it is with him, as it has been before him with his compeer and his congeners, the majority of the great poets in our language. Has not Moore, for example, in this way taken to himself for ever as his the shamrock—and Scott the purpling heather—and Campbell the red velvet strings of love-lies-bleeding? Has not Keats his sprig of basil—and Blair his branch of funereal yew—and Chatterton his trail of lamenting willow? But that Burns, again, according [to] his own showing, was endowed by his Muse (the Muse of Scotland) with the glistening bough of the holly, he might perchance have contested with Dan Chaucer the latter's now undisputed right to the possession as his of the darling blossom of the daisy. As indubitably, moreover, as the daisy belongs to Chaucer and the holly to Burns—so has Shelley assumed to himself the sensitive plant, and Wordsworth the little celandine and the daffodils, and Cowper the rose and the water lily, and Leigh Hunt the flowering branch of May, and Tennyson the gorgeous blossom of the passion flower, if only by right of the 'splendid tear' shed upon it at the garden porch in 'Maud,' and Milton 'the yellow cowslip and the pale primrose,' and Shakespeare, for that matter, almost every bloom of the parterre or of the wilderness. And, as it has been with those, so it is now and henceforth with this true American Poet Walt Whitman, who has made the lilac—the fragrant, blueish-pink blossoms of the lilac—his own completely. Turning the leaves of these poems, the reader may say before the book is closed as the Poet himself says or rather sings with a sort of rapture—</p><p>'Yet the lilac with mastering odour holds me.'</p><p>For it blossoms, and breathes forth its haunting perfume, and verdantly unfolds its delicate heart-shaped leaves, again and again, all through these pages—more especially in the great Nocturn on the Death of President Lincoln. And so, with the fragrance of the lilacs in our nostrils, and with the song of the lamenting bird in our ears, and with the thought in our hearts of the manly poet himself going his sickening rounds in the ghastly hospitals, all through the great American War, accompanied, as he went down the wards, by his attendant, bearing sponge, and pail, and lint, and ointment, for the cleansing and the binding up of many loathsome wounds, we close this beautiful volume with a renewal of our grateful acknowledgments to Mr. Rossetti, and with a benison to Walt Whitman.</p><p><strong>POEMS BY WALT WHITMAN.*</strong></p><p>Englishmen know nothing of Walt (Walter) Whitman, except the occasional brilliant scraps which English papers copy from their American contemporaries. Englishmen know nothing—excepting the very few cultivated Englishmen who have crossed the Atlantic, met the author, and learned to admire him and his books. Mr. William Michael Rossetti has been for some time what may be called a disciple of Whitman. If he did not absolutely discover him, he was at least one of the very first who heard of the discovery. Here is the result: a volume, a selection of Mr. Whitman's poems, containing probably one-half of what he has written, and that half not necessarily the best. And here it must be said, that having read the volume with great interest—for Rumour had been busy—and with deep gratification, for the present we must suffer description to assume the place of criticism, since one reading is quite insufficient, and time is required in order that the strangeness of the beauty may be absorbed and assimilated, before any proper estimate of it could be formed. It is strange, at the outset, to find that the other half of the author's writings is so disfigured by violation of morality and decency, as to be rather too much for the English reader; and, stranger still, to hear Mr. Rossetti praying for a complete edition. As far as can be made out, Mr. Whitman considers everything noble, because of divine origin, and everything a fair subject for words. Therefore he goes on about matters fleshly, spiritual, and mixed—always calling spades spades, in a fashion not to be tolerated by ordinary nerves. It will be observed that the volume is called 'Poems,' and it is certain that not one man in a thousand would so describe them. And yet we can say that there is not one page which is not thoroughly poetic. The simple thing is, not that there is no rhyme—which is, of course, unessential; but that there is no rhythm, no measure, no attempt at complying with any of the universally known demands of versification, and which we are still simple enough to consider one of the absolute demands of poetry. A skin of kid is not a kid glove. This is a dilemma which the ordinary English reader will find difficult to get over; but he must read Mr. Rossetti's prefatory sketch, which is in every way an excellent piece of writing from an accomplished man, and which seems to err only on the side of absolute infatuation. Mr. Rossetti insists that it must be taken as an altogether new poetry: as something as distinctively American as Niagara and the Rocky Mountains, and having no more in common with English poetry than Niagara has with the dripping well at Hastings, or the Rocky Mountains with Primrose-hill! A specimen or two of these strange productions shall be given; but it is proper to say that they are amongst the most musical we can find, and the easiest to understand. The author is always mystical—always democratic—always speaking in ghastly praise of death. But he roams over every or any kind of subject, and seems always to be in 'communion with nature.' He chatters with the birds, and is sometimes as incomprehensible. And he hurls large sayings at the mountains, who echo back peal after peal, and all of which enthusiasts are humbly entreated to suppose that the author understands! Here is an exquisitely musical little piece, the commencement of President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn:—</p><p>When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed,<br>And the great star early drooped in the western sky in <br>the night,<br>I mourned…and yet shall mourn with ever-returning <br>spring.<br>O ever-returning spring! trinity sure to me you bring;<br>Lilac blooming perennial, and drooping star in the west,<br>And thought of him I love.</p><p>O powerful, western, fallen star!<br>O shades of night! O moody, tearful night!<br>O great star disappeared! O the black murk that hides <br>the star!<br>O cruel hands that hold me powerless! O helpless soul <br>of me!<br>O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul!</p><p>In the door-yard, fronting an old farm-house, near the <br>whitewashed palings,<br>Stands the lilac bush, tall-growing, with heart-shaped <br>leaves of rich green,<br>With many a pointed blossom, rising delicate, with the <br>perfume strong I love,<br>With every leaf a miracle; and from this bush in the<br> door-yard,<br>With delicate-coloured blossoms, and heart-shaped <br>leaves of rich green,<br>A sprig, with its flower, I break.</p><p>In the swamp, in secluded recesses,<br>A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.<br>Solitary, the thrush,<br>The hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settle-<br>ments,<br>Sings by himself a song.<br>Song of the bleeding throat!<br>Death's outlet song of life—for well, dear brother, I <br>know,<br>If thou wast not gifted to sing, thou would surely die.</p><p>Page after page of this curiously poetical 'Funeral Hymn' might be reprinted here, for the reader's pleasure; but our object is to provoke, not to appease, the taste. Here is another short piece which is perfect—that is, complete. In it may be seen with what brilliant novelty the poet can handle the grimmest possible of all earthly and spiritual subjects:—</p><p><em>TO ONE SHORTLY TO DIE.</em><br>From all the rest I single out you, having a message for <br>you;<br>You are to die—Let others tell you what they please, I <br>cannot prevaricate,<br>I am exact and merciless; but I love you—there is no <br>escape for you.</p><p>Softly I lay my right hand upon you—you just feel it;<br>I do not argue—I bend my head close, and half-<br> envelop it,<br>I sit quietly by—I remain faithful,<br>I am more than nurse, more than parent or neighbour,<br>I absolve you from all except yourself, spiritual, bodily<br> —that is eternal—<br>The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious.<br>The sun bursts through in unlooked for directions!<br>Strong thoughts fill you, and confidence—you smile!<br>You forget you are sick, as I forget you are sick.<br>You do not see the medicines—you do not mind the<br> weeping friends—I am with you.<br>I exclude others from you—there is nothing to be com- <br>miserated,<br>I do not commiserate—I congratulate you.</p><p>Let people quarrel as they please about what is or is not poetry; but Mr. Walt Whitman is beyond all question a poet.</p><p>* 'Poems by Walt Whitman.' Selected and edited by William Michael Rossetti —J.C. Hotten.</p><p><em>Poems</em>. By Walt Whitman. Selected and edited by William Michael Rossetti (Hotten.)</p><p>THE selections here given from the poems of Walt Whitman form, we are told, nearly half of his entire works. Mr. Rossetti's objects in the present compilation have been, first, to exclude every poem that could fairly be deemed offensive; and, secondly, to include whatever, being free from just or unjust censure on the ground of decorum, is at the same time highest as poetry and most characteristic of the writer. The editor has wisely, and with a proper reverence for one in whose genius he believes, refrained from culling what are called 'beauties' from such poems as might be thought objectionable. He has hacked and spoilt no piece by depriving it of the unity and continuity which make it vital; and thus, though we have not here the whole of Whitman, what we have is genuinely his own. It follows from the process adopted that we are not now called upon to weigh the accusations which have been brought against the writer in America for his license of expression in morals (morals being, of course, to be understood in a special and restricted sense), but simply to examine his credentials as a poet.</p><p>In a Preface which, on the whole, is written with his usual discernment and happiness of exposition, Mr. Rossetti observes of Whitman, 'He may be termed formless by those who, not without much reason to show for themselves, are wedded to the established forms and ratified refinements of poetic art; but it seems reasonable to enlarge the canon till it includes so great and startling a genius, rather than to draw it close and exclude him.' We see, however, no reason why the usual definition of an art should be changed for the sake of embracing in its limits one who might otherwise stand without them. The question now at issue, is not whether Mr. Whitman is a great thinker, but whether he is a great poet. Now, by common consent the vital constituents of poetry are emotion and imagination. By imagination we mean the power of conceiving ideas and of representing them by adequate symbols to the senses.</p><p>Judged by this admitted test, what shall we say of Walt Whitman? That some entire poems in this collection, and many scattered passages in other poems, bear the test triumphantly, few, if qualified to judge, will doubt. On the other hand, we have here many pages (probably the greater number) of which it would be difficult to maintain that they are poetry in any sense of that word which has yet been accepted. Thus, in the address 'To Working Men,' who can say that, however exalted by the prevailing idea of the piece, any item in the following catalogue, with the one exception marked in italics, is in itself poetical?—</p><p>House-building, measuring, sawing the boards;Blacksmithing, glass-blowing, nail-making, coopering, tin- roofing, shingle-dressing,Ship-joining, dock-building, fish-curing, ferrying, flagging <br>of side-walks by flaggers,<br>The pump, the pile-driver, the great derrick, the coal- <br>kiln and brick-kiln,<br>Coal-mines, and all that is down there,—the lamps in the <br>darkness, echoes, songs, what meditations, what <br>vast native thoughts looking through smutched faces,<br>Iron-works, forge-fires in the mountains, or by the river-<br> banks—men around feeling the melt with huge <br>crowbars—lumps of ore, the due combining of ore, <br>limestone, coal—the blast-furnace and the puddling- <br>furnace, the loup-lump at the bottom of the melt at <br>last—the rolling-mill, the stumpy bars of pig-iron,<br> the strong, clean-shaped T-rail for railroads;<br>Oil-works, silk-works, white-lead-works, the sugar-house, <br>steam-saws, the great mills and factories.</p><p>Even in the composition called 'A Poet,' which, besides its high strain of thought, is very interesting as a revelation of Whitman's individuality, there is far more of theory than of imagination. When he writes of the poet—</p><p>Him all wait for—him all yield up to—his word is deci-<br>sive and final,<br>Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves, <br>as amid light,<br>Him they immerse, and he immerses them.<br>Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the land-<br>scape, people, animals,<br>The profound earth and its attributes, and the unquiet <br>ocean (so tell I my morning's romanza),<br>All enjoyments and properties, and money, and whatever <br>money will buy,<br>The best farms—others toiling and planting, and he <br>unavoidably reaps,<br>The noblest and costliest cities—others grading and build-<br>ing, and he domiciles there,<br>Nothing for anyone, but what is for him—near and far <br>are for him,—the ships in the offing,<br>The perpetual shows and marches on land, are for him, if <br>they are for anybody—</p><p>the reader may or may not find in the lines truth of doctrine, but he assuredly will not find beauty of expression. Turning, on the contrary, to the pieces named respectively 'Assimilations,' 'Burial,' 'The Waters,' 'A Ship,' 'President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn,' and 'A Word out of the Sea,' he will scarcely deny that they possess striking truth and beauty of description, and, still better, that subtle and informing power which unobtrusively converts all outward things into symbols, just as the soul makes for itself a symbol of the body which it pervades and rules. This unconscious power of symbolization—quite distinct from, and even opposed to, the mechanical ingenuity of allegory—is nowhere more delightfully evinced by Whitman than in 'A Word out of the Sea,' to our thinking the poem of the book. A boy discovers a bird's-nest in some briars that skirt the sea-shore. Day after day he watches the movements of the male bird and his mate, listens to the singing and the chirping by which they express their happiness. At length,</p><p>May-be killed unknown to her mate,<br>One forenoon the she-bird crouched not on the nest,<br>Nor returned that afternoon, nor the next,<br>Nor ever returned again.</p><p>The boy continues to note the solitary bird flitting restlessly from spot to spot on the shore, and at times pouring forth a mournful song, the desolation, the longing and the brief beguiling hope of which the listener translates into human speech. To the boy's ear the bird sings as follows:—</p><p>Soothe! soothe! soothe!<br>Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,<br>And again another behind, embracing and lapping, every <br>one close,—<br>But my love soothes not me, not me.</p><p>Low hangs the moon—it rose late;<br>O it is lagging—O I think it is heavy with love, with love.</p><p>O madly the sea pushes, pushes upon the land,<br>With love—with love.</p><p>O night! do I not see my love fluttering out there among <br>the breakers?<br>What is that little black thing I see there in the white?</p><p>Loud! loud! loud!<br>Loud I call to you, my love!<br>High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves;<br>Surely you must know who is here, is here;<br>You must know who I am, my love.</p><p>Low-hanging moon!<br>What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?<br>O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!<br>O moon, do not keep her from me any longer!</p><p>Land! land! O land!<br>Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my <br>mate back again, if you only would;<br>For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.</p><p>O rising stars!<br>Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with <br>some of you.</p><p>O throat! O trembling throat!<br>Sound clearer through the atmosphere!<br>Pierce the woods, the earth;<br>Somewhere, listening to catch you, must be the one I want.</p><p>Shake out, carols!<br>Solitary here—the night's carols!<br>Carols of lonesome love! Death's carols!<br>Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!<br>O, under that moon, where she droops almost down into<br> the sea!<br>O reckless, despairing carols!</p><p>But soft! sink low;<br>Soft! let me just murmur;<br>And do you wait a moment, you husky-noised sea;<br>For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to<br> me,<br>So faint—I must be still, be still to listen;<br>But not altogether still, for then she might not come <br>immediately to me.</p><p>Hither, my love!<br>Here I am! Here!<br>With this just-sustained note I announce myself to you;<br>This gentle call is for you, my love, for you!</p><p>Do not be decoyed elsewhere!<br>That is the whistle of the wind—it is not my voice;<br>That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray;<br>Those are the shadows of leaves.</p><p>O darkness! O in vain!<br>O I am very sick and sorrowful!<br>O brown halo in the sky, near the moon, drooping upon <br>the sea!<br>O troubled reflection in the sea!<br>O throat! O throbbing heart!<br>O all!—and I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night!</p><p>Yet I murmur, murmur on!<br>O murmurs—you yourselves make me continue to sing, I <br>know not why.</p><p>O past! O life! O songs of joy!<br>In the air—in the woods—over fields;<br>Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!<br>But my love no more, no more with me!<br>We two together no more!</p><p>The plaint of the bird arouses in the boy, too, the sense of something missed and yearned for. A joy has vanished from the soul as its mate from the bird. Shall the ideal of youth that has taken wing return to earth no more? Shall the yearning for it ever be satisfied, and by what?—</p><p>Answering, the Sea,<br>Delaying not, hurrying not,<br>Whispered me through the night and very plainly before<br> daybreak,<br>Lisped to me the low and delicious word DEATH.</p><p>Of the sublimated passion and sweetness of the above, of the minuteness with which the most delicate transitions of feeling are caught, and of the grand yet melancholy suggestiveness which sets the whole picture, as it were, in a frame of sad sunset glory, we can hardly speak in terms of praise too high. That Whitman can write noble poetry, this one example conclusively testifies.Of the writer, generally, it may be said, that he is universal in his sympathies, (with the sole exception that he cannot recognize the possibility of goodness in any man who happens to be born an aristocrat,)—that (with this exception) he believes in the capacity for virtue, latent or developed, of all his fellows—believes that the best man is but the full and perfected expression of the worth and power hidden in the worst,—believes that in point of art it is right to express in speech all that is true in fact, and to regard all processes and things, natural or mechanical, that have once been associated with man as sanctified thereby. The 'homo sum' and the deductions drawn from it, have never found a more zealous advocate.</p><p>It is difficult to describe a mind so varied and yet so peculiar in a few phrases. Yet we will venture to designate Mr. Whitman as a wide, sincere, passionate thinker,—presenting in himself a new combination of separate views, which are not particularly new in themselves. This is not said to his disadvantage, for truisms, after all, lie at the root of the world's progress. The expansiveness of his mind includes imagination, no doubt, but rather as a constituent than as a characteristic. He resembles those vast tracts of country in which is found the utmost diversity of surface, and in which long intervals of homely or even barren scenery precede and succeed glorious manifestations of Nature. He is so large and generic in his mode of thinking that he often scatters beauty in the seed rather than reveals it in the flowers; at other times, nothing can surpass the truthful minuteness with which he paints the most delicate nuances of feeling. He is a fine poet, though it would be a great error to say that all is poetry to which he has given the name.For a brief and excellent summary of Whitman's life and writings, we refer the reader to Mr. Rossetti's Preface—a composition disfigured only by a somewhat puerile display of contempt for his fellow critics. His allegations against them may or may not be just; but their errors, if real, would have been more gracefully improved by that superior example which Mr. Rossetti so consciously affords, than by his unnecessary invectives.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S POEMS.*</strong></p><p>SOME years ago, when a few copies of a volume called Leaves of Grass found their way into this country from America, the general verdict of those who had an opportunity of examining the book was that much of it was indescribably filthy, most of it mere incoherent rhapsody, none of it what could be termed poetry in any sense of the word, and that, unless at the hands of some enterprising Holywell Street publisher, it had no chance of the honour of an English reprint. In part this opinion is already proved to have been a mistaken one, for a West-end publisher has taken compassion on the stranger, and now presents it to the British public in a comely form. It may be as well to state at the outset, that the volume published by Mr. Hotten is not precisely a reprint of the original Leaves of Grass. It contains much new matter written since the appearance of that work, and does not contain any of the pieces marked by that peculiar freedom of speech which is generally associated in men's minds with the name of Walt Whitman. For the sake of all parties, the prurient as well as the prudish, lest the one should be unnecessarily alarmed or the other led into an unremunerative venture, it is only fair to say that there is nothing in the present edition to disqualify it for decent society, not to say qualify it for a place in the Bibliothèque bleue. It has cost Mr. Rossetti severe pangs, so he informs us, to part with so much as, from considerations of prudence, he has been obliged to exclude. 'This peculiarly nervous age,' this 'mealy-mouthed British nineteenth century,' with its present absurd notions about decency, morality, and propriety, could not be expected to receive 'the indecencies scattered through Whitman's writings' in that æsthetic spirit in which they should be accepted; and, as he was unwilling to mutilate, 'the consequence is that the reader loses in toto several important poems, and some extremely fine ones—notably one of quite exceptional value and excellence, entitled Walt Whitman.' In one respect we are willing to admit the loss sustained in this last instance. The 'poem' here referred to is the one which contains the key to Walt Whitman's philosophy and poetic theory. It is in it that he describes himself and his qualifications for the office of poet of the future, grounding his claim upon the fact of his being 'hankering, gross, mystical, nude, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshy, sensual, no more modest than immodest'; and proposing to produce poetry of corresponding qualities, a promise which we must say he most conscientiously fulfils. Its excellence may be open to question, but about its value to the reader who wishes to understand Walt Whitman there can be no doubt whatever.</p><p>The present edition is to be considered as an experiment. By excluding everything offensive, the editor hopes to induce people to reconsider the case of Walt Whitman, and reverse the verdict which has been already pronounced. This, we need scarcely observe, is rather more than they can be fairly asked to do, while the evidence which supports the gravest of the charges brought against him is suppressed. But this is not all that Mr. Rossetti expects. The present selection is so to brace and fortify the British mind that in a short time, he trusts, it will be able to relish what now in its weakness it rejects. A complete edition of Walt Whitman, with all the dirt left in, he looks forward to as 'the right and crowning result' of his labours. This is but the schoolboy's pudding, which, if we only finish it off, is to be succeeded by a full meal of the uncommonly strong meat he has in reserve for us. A fellow-countryman of the poet's, who had unsuccessfully besieged the virtue of a married lady, is said to have consoled himself with the reflection that, at any rate, he had 'lowered her moral tone some.' Though he himself had not gained his point, his labours, he thought, had diminished the difficulties in the way of the next comer. Something of this sort appears to be the modest mission of the present volume. We must confess we should very much prefer to see Mr. Rossetti employing himself on some task more worthy of his abilities. He has on many occasions done good service as a critic to literature and art, but we cannot look upon his present enterprise as one in any way beneficial to either. He desires to have Walt Whitman recognised, not merely as a great poet, but as the founder of a new school of poetic literature which is to be greater and more powerful than any the world has yet seen. He is not, it is true, entirely alone in this attempt. There have been already certain indications of a Walt Whitman movement in one or two other quarters. More than a year ago there was a paper in the Fortnightly Review, which, however, was not so much a criticism of his poetry as of his person, the writer having had, as well as we recollect, the privilege of reviewing him as he bathed—an important advantage, certainly, in the case of a poet whose principal theme is his own body. Then Mr. Robert Buchanan took him up in the Broadway magazine, and, saying nearly all that has ever been said against Walt Whitman—that he is no poet and no artist, that he is gross, monotonous, loud, obscure, prone to coarse animalism and to talking rank nonsense—nevertheless arrived at pretty much the same conclusion as Mr. Rossetti, at least as to the powerful influence he is to exercise over the literature of the future. Something of this sort we might, indeed, have expected. There are people whose reading of the Horatian saying about popular opinion is 'nunquam vulgus rectum videt,' and who always set themselves to find virtues in everything that is generally condemned. Besides, it would be idle to deny that Walt Whitman has many attractions for minds of a certain class. He is loud, swaggering, and self-assertive, and so gets credit for strength with those who worship nothing that is not strong. He is utterly lawless, and in consequence passes for being a great original genius. His produce is unlike anything else that has ever appeared in literature, and that is enough for those who are always on the look-out for novelty. He is rich in all those qualities of haziness, incoherence, and obscurity which seem to be the first that some readers nowadays look for in poetry. But, above all, he runs amuck with conventionalities and decencies of every sort, which naturally endears him to those silly people who take a childish delight in seeing the respectabilities of the world pulled by the nose, and what they consider its stupid prejudices shocked. We need scarcely say we do not suspect a man of Mr. Rossetti's taste and judgment of this kind of enthusiasm. If we were to hazard a theory, we should be inclined to attribute his advocacy of Walt Whitman's poetical claims to an impatience of the feebleness, emptiness, and sentimentality so abundant in modern poetry. The feeling is one with which we do not quarrel; we only object to the form in which it finds expression. A plague of tinkling cymbals is not to be met by a counter treatment of sounding brass.</p><p>An admirer of Walt Whitman has one immense advantage. There is no standard by which his idol can be measured, no known test which can be applied to prove his quality. There is, therefore, a wide field for that dogmatic assertion which is the favourite argument of the transcendental critic. You must not object that his poetry has no melody, music, or form. It is something above and beyond all requirements of that kind. You are not to raise the objection that in a great deal of what he writes there is no meaning at all, and in a great deal more the meaning, when got at, is utterly commonplace. Poetry like Walt Whitman's is not to be judged of by any one who is influenced by narrow considerations of meaning. You are not to take exception to his language, that it is a vile jargon of his own coining. A poet of this order naturally rises above the trammels of precedent in the matter of language. As to the absence of imagination, invention, fancy, art, and sundry other things more or less looked for in poetry, to complain of this in the present instance only shows that you are incapable of understanding the subject. This sort of argument always tells powerfully with the timid, with those people who are haunted by a nervous dread of being set down as dull and commonplace if they allow common sense to influence their judgment; and besides, it has the merit of being unanswerable, except by contradiction. When a man shows you something with all the outward and visible signs of a wheelbarrow, and tells you it is an Act of Parliament, it is very hard to know what to say to him; and it is just as hard to know what to say when you are offered something like the following and told it is poetry, and poetry of a very high order. As the admirers of Walt Whitman always protest against his being judged of fragmentarily, we take the shortest poem we can find, instead of giving the queerest extract:—</p><p><em>VISAGES.</em><br>Of the visages of things—And of piercing through to the accepted hells <br>beneath.<br>Of ugliness—To me there is just as much in it as there is in beauty— <br>And now the ugliness of human beings is acceptable to me.<br>Of detected persons—To me, detected persons are not, in any respect, <br>worse than undetected persons—and are not in any respect worse than <br>I am myself.<br>Of criminals—To me, any judge, or any juror, is equally criminal—and <br>any reputable person is also—and the President is also.</p><p>Now it may be that this is not balderdash, though we must confess to a strong suspicion that it is; but if it is poetry, all we can say is, we must find some other word for Shakespeare. Walt Whitman himself is much more candid on this point than his advocates. He certainly declares himself to be a poet, but at the same time he describes the offspring of his muse as a 'barbaric yawp.' We have no very definite idea as to the precise nature of a yawp, but, whatever it may be, it can scarcely be poetry.</p><p>We must do Mr. Rossetti the justice of admitting that he does not entirely rely on dogmatism in pleading the cause of his protégé. He does assign some few reasons why Walt Whitman should be accepted as 'the poet of the epoch.' In a paper which appeared in a weekly journal, he puts the claim on the rather curious ground of his being 'an initiator in the scheme and structure of his writings, and an individual of audacious personal ascendant.' But in the preface to the present volume he comes more plainly to the point. The reader, he says, is not to ask himself, or return any answer to the questions, whether or not Walt Whitman is like other poets, or whether or not the particular application of rules of art which is found to hold good in the works of other poets, and to constitute a part of their excellence, can be traced also in his work. 'Let the questions rather be—Is he powerful? Is he American? Is he new? Is he rousing? Does he feel, and make me feel?' To each of these questions we should be disposed to answer simply 'No,' were it not that an unqualified negative is scarcely polite. We can see no reason for considering Walt Whitman powerful. Strong he may be, but it is only in the sense in which an onion is strong. His noise, bluster, and arrogance are no more indications of true strength than the swagger of the professional athlete at a country fair, who struts up and down the stage in salmon-coloured tights, and passes for a Hercules with the crowd from the way in which he feels his muscles in public. That he is American in one sense we must admit. He is something which no other country could have produced. He is American as certain forms of rowdyism and vulgarity, excrescences on American institutions, are American. But that he is American in the sense of being representative of American taste, intellect, or cultivation, we should be very sorry indeed to believe. New he certainly is, but it is only in his audacity, and in the abnormal structure of his poetry; there is not a new thought in his writings from beginning to end. As to the other questions, the answer must depend very much on individual temperament. Whether or not he himself feels we cannot tell, but, so far from being rousing or making his reader feel, we should say that with ninety-nine out of a hundred average readers Walt Whitman, taken in any quantity, would be found to be about as soporific a poet as ever produced a yawn. But even if all these questions could be answered in the affirmative—even if we were to concede that Walt Whitman is powerful and new and American and rousing, and throw into the bargain what his friends invariably lay great stress upon, his magnificent physique and his irreproachable character in private life—still all this, we submit, does not make him out to be a poet. To call a man a poet merely because he holds forth in rhapsodical style about one man being as good as another, everything being all right, every one having a right 'to do as he dam pleases'—if we may venture to quote the concise language of Transatlantic liberty—and other dogmas of the same sort, is to confuse the functions of the poet and the stump orator; and generally, when Walt Whitman has any meaning at all, it amounts to no more than this. Very often he has no meaning whatever. In his fury he breaks out into a mere perspiration of words, and strings substantives together for pages on a stretch, the result being a something which is as much like poetry as an auctioneer's catalogue. To be sure there is scattered through his pages a vast amount of that vagueness which to some tastes has the true poetic charm. No doubt there are people who consider this sort of thing very fine:</p><p><em>OF THE TERRIBLE DOUBT OF APPEARANCES.</em><br>The skies of day and night—colours, densities, forms—May-be these are <br>(as doubtless they are) only apparitions, and the real something has <br>yet to be known;</p><p>May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem) <br>as from my present point of view—And might prove (as of course <br>they would) naught of what they appear, or naught any how, from <br>entirely changed points of view.</p><p>But if it is very fine, then so is Miss Codger's outburst on being introduced to Elijah Pogram:—</p><p>But why we call them so, or why impressed they are, or if impressed they are at all, or if at all we are, or if there really is, oh gasping one! a Pogram or a Hominy, or any active principle, to which we give those titles, is a topic, spirit-searching, light-abandoned, much too vast to enter on.</p><p>But of course the special charm of Walt Whitman is that he is so—what his admirers call unconventional; that is, that he says things which other people do not say, and in language which other people do not generally use. His unconventionality, however, is of a very cheap sort. It is nothing more than the unconventionality of the man who considers clothes conventional, and goes about without them. It is true that for the present we are spared the bolder strokes of his genius in this respect, but, as has been already mentioned, it is only for the present; and besides, Walt Whitman's grossness is not accidental, but constitutional. It arises partly from an insensibility to the difference between that which is naturally offensive and that which is not, partly from his peculiar theory of poetry. As it is a fundamental principle of his to recognise no law of any kind, and to submit to no restrictions of artistic propriety, it follows that with him all subjects are equally fit for poetic treatment. As Mr. Rossetti puts it, 'he knows of no reason why what is universally seen and known, necessary and right, should not also be allowed and proclaimed in speech,' and it is just this ignorance of his which, independently of other reasons, makes any attempt to set him up as a poetic model mischievous to the interests of literary art. It is not a question of squeamishness or hyper sensitiveness. There is no prudery in objecting to nastiness, nor is there any originality, honesty, manliness, or courage in obtruding what even instinct teaches us to avoid. We cannot say, however, that we anticipate any serious injury to English or American literature from the influence or popularity of Walt Whitman's poetry, so long at least as people are courageous enough to use their common sense, and do not allow themselves to be led away by transcendental 'high-falutin' into pretending an admiration which they do not feel.</p><p>∗ Poems by Walt Whitman. Selected and Edited by William Michael Rossetti London: John Camden Hotten. 1868.</p><p>Of the republication of Walt Whitman's poems in England, Mr. Smalley writes to the Tribune:</p><p>'The writings of Walt Whitman, which, on the title page of the English reprint, are described as poems, are reviewed this week in The Athenæum, with more respect than the English press has generally accorded to them. Mr. Dixon's paper thinks some entire pieces embody the vital constituents of poetry, viz., emotion and imagination; though of the greater number of pages it would be difficult to maintain that they are poetry in any sense of that word which has yet been accepted. The poem of the book is considered to be 'A Word out of the Sea,' which 'conclusively testifies that Whitman can write noble poetry.' This, however, is a verdict, not upon the whole writings of Mr. Whitman, but upon so many of them as his editor, Mr. W. M. Rossetti, has thought it prudent to put into English print. No publisher could be found—not even Mr. Swinburne's—willing to affront both the law and public sense of decency by an unexpurgated issue of writings which owe their toleration in America to their obscurity. In private, Mr. Whitman has been more or less a topic of discussion. I have never yet heard, from any competent source, a favorable opinion on his claims. I have heard but one such opinion from any English source whatever, and that was from a poet whose critical judgment may have yielded to his sympathy with the worst eccentricities of Whitman's muse. But there is plenty of stern criticism from men who are usually tolerant, and of contemptuous criticism from men who are usually merciful. Mr. Carlyle likens him to a buffalo, useful in fertilizing the soil, but mistaken in supposing that his contributions of that sort are matters which the world desires to contemplate closely.'</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>FAINT praise may harm the prose-writer, but there is nothing which predisposes us against a poet so much as extravagant praise; if we are not very young, and have little enthusiasm to spare about anything, we especially resent it. The unreasonable laudation (now so common) makes us as unreasonably despise its object. 'As it is impossible to conceive a world without a Shakespeare, so we cannot picture it to ourselves without this new sweet singer, Jones.' Bother Jones! We that have known Keats and Shelley, and Byron, and Wordsworth and Coleridge, to be told that there has been no such poet as Jones!</p><p>Not a little ludicrous eulogy of this sort has been poured of late upon the American poet whose name stands at the head of this paper, but he is really noteworthy nevertheless. He is the first characteristic poetical writer that the United States have produced. Longfellow is but Tennyson and water; and as for the other Transatlantic bards, they have produced solitary poems of great merit, but none which might not have been written by an Englishman of genius, who had paid great attention to the panoramas of the Mississippi or of the Prairies which have been unfolded from time to time in Leicester Square. Whitman's very faults are national. The brag, and bluster, and self-assertion of the man are American only; the fulsome 'cracking-up' of his own nation is such as would not be ventured upon by a British bard; the frequent bathos—the use of newspaper terms and of terms which have no existence out of New York, and in which you almost hear the American nasal twang, are all characteristic. He is Yankee to the backbone; Yankee, also, it must however be added, in his outspoken independence of thought, in his audacious originality, in his perfect freedom from conventional twaddle, and in his contempt for accidental rank of all sorts. He has named half his volume Chants Democratic, and though they are not chants, nor anything like it, they are certainly democratic. He does not write verse at all, which is fortunate, for he would certainly not be particular about his rhymes; nor does he even write blank verse; but he has invented a certain rolling changeful metre of his own, with, as his English editor∗ truly remarks, 'a very powerful and majestic rhythmical sense throughout.' He sometimes furnishes long strings of detached items—very like the list of goods furnished by shops to their customers; but they are 'not devoid of a certain primitive effectiveness' by any means.</p><p>The doctrine of nihil humanum, &c. was never pushed to such extreme limits as by Walt Whitman. If a man could gain the suffrages of the human race by flattering them with the sense of their tremendous importance, this poet would be king of the world.</p><p>Small is the theme of the following chant, yet the <br>greatest—namely, ONE'S-SELF; that wondrous <br>thing, a simple separate person. That, for the <br>use of the New World, I sing.<br>Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. <br>Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is <br>worthy for the Muse: I say the form complete <br>is worthier far. The female equally with the <br>male I sing.<br>Nor cease at the theme of One's-self. I speak the <br>word of the modern, the word En Masse.</p><p>Such is Mr Whitman's programme. If he did not speak 'the word of the modern' quite so often, or, at least, not borrow it from the penny-a-liner, it would be better for his fame. Also, through singing 'Man's physiology complete,' he has caused Mr Rossetti to be at the trouble of preparing the present 'Bowdlerised,' or excised edition of his works, to suit the squeamish tastes of the Old Country. So please, ladies, be particular to ask for the above-mentioned edition. There is nothing in that which you may not read, or the book would not be noticed in these columns.</p><p>Whitman's poetry reminds us, as we have said, of no other poet, but in his prose we seem to recognise some kinship to Emerson's. Here is a fine passage from the preface to his Leaves of Grass [the titles of his poems are unattractive, being almost always affected or unmeaning], insisting upon the importance of human act, word, thought, and the indestructibility of their results.</p><p>All that a person does or thinks is of consequence. Not a move can a man or woman make that affects him or her in a day or a month, or any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour of death, but the same affects him or her onward afterward through the indirect lifetime. The indirect is always as great and real as the direct. The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the body. Not one name of word or deed …not of the putrid veins of gluttons or rum-drinkers …not peculation, or cunning, or betrayal, or murder …no serpentine poison of those that seduce women …not the foolish yielding of women …not of the attainment of gain by discreditable means …not any nastiness of appetite …not any harshness of officers to men, or judges to prisoners, or fathers to sons, or sons to fathers, or of husbands to wives, or bosses to their boys …not of greedy looks or malignant wishes …nor any of the wiles practised by people upon themselves …ever is or ever can be stamped on the programme, but it is duly realised and returned, and that returned in further performances, and they returned again. Nor can the push of charity or personal force ever be anything else than the profoundest reason, whether it bring arguments to hand or no. No specification is necessary …to add, or subtract, or divide is in vain. Little or big, learned or unlearned, white or black, legal or illegal, sick or well, from the first inspiration down the windpipe to the last expiration out of it, all that a male or female does that is vigorous, and benevolent, and clean, is so much sure profit to him or her in the unshakable order of the universe, and through the whole scope of it for ever.

Other states, he says, indicate themselves by their deputies, but the United States always most in its common people.</p><p>Their manners, speech, dress, friendships—the freshness and candour of their physiognomy—the picturesque looseness of their carriage—their deathless attachment to freedom—their aversion to anything indecorous, or soft, or mean—the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of one state by the citizens of all other states—the fierceness of their roused resentment—their curiosity and welcome of novelty—their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy—their susceptibility to a slight—the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors—the fluency of their speech—their delight in music, the sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance of soul—their good temper and open-handedness—the terrible significance of their elections, the President's taking off his hat to them, not they to him—these, too, are unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of it.</p><p>In the meantime, however, Walt Whitman will try his hand.</p><p>Starting from fish-shape Paumanok,† where I was <br>born,<br>Well-begotten, and raised by a perfect mother;<br>After roaming many lands—lover of populous <br>pavements;<br>Dweller in Mannahatta‡, city of ships, my city— <br>or on southern savannas;<br>Or a soldier camped, or carrying my knapsack and <br>gun—or a miner in California;<br>Or rude in my home in Dakotah's woods, my diet <br>meat, my drink from the spring;<br>Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep <br>recess,<br>Far from the clank of crowds, intervals passing, <br>rapt and happy;<br>Aware of the fresh free giver, the flowing Missouri <br>—aware of mighty Niagara;<br>Aware of the buffalo herds, grazing the plains—the <br>hirsute and strong-breasted bull;<br>Of earths, rocks, fifth-month flowers, experienced— <br>stars, rain, snow, my amaze;<br>Having studied the mocking-bird's tones, and the <br>mountain hawk's,<br>And heard at dusk the unrivalled one, the hermit <br>thrush, from the swamp-cedars,<br>Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New <br>World.</p><p>He even dates from the United States era; in 1856, he writes:</p><p>In the Year 80 of the States,<br>My tongue, every atom of my blood, formed from<br> this soil, this air,<br>Born here of parents born here, from parents the <br>same, and their parents the same,<br>I, now thirty-six years old, in perfect health begin,<br>Hoping to cease not till death.<br>Creeds and schools in abeyance<br>(Retiring back a while, sufficed at what they are,<br> but never forgotten),<br>I harbour, for good or bad—I permit to speak, at<br> every hazard—<br>Nature now without check, with original energy.</p><p>Yet he is so good as to say that former experience and instruction have not been altogether thrown away; he is grateful, only let it be distinctly understood, that he is under no slavish sense of obligation; that the gratitude must be reciprocal.</p><p>I conned old times;<br>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:<br>Now, if eligible, O that the great masters might <br>return and study me!</p><p>If eligible? One would think he pictured himself as an investment. You must not be put off your liking, reader, by these blots.

Half a century ago, he would have been wholly unintelligible; and half a century hence, it is possible that he will be forgotten; but he will leave much seed behind him, and perhaps found a school whose pupils will be greater than their master. His messages to the Poor and Fallen (who will most certainly never receive them, by the by) are full of tenderness and fraternal love, but never of pity: why should they be pitied, who are as high as the highest, and as good as the best? Nay, even crime does not cut them off from their equality with him, or him from his sympathy with them.</p><p>If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become <br>so for your sake;<br>If you remember your foolish and outlawed deeds, <br>do you think I cannot remember my own <br>foolish and outlawed deeds?<br>If you carouse at the table, I carouse at the opposite<br> side of the table;<br>If you meet some stranger in the streets, and love <br>him or her—why, I often meet strangers in the <br>street, and love them.</p><p>Why, what have you thought of yourself?<br>Is it you then that thought yourself less?<br>Is it you that thought the President greater than you?<br>Or the rich better off than you? or the educated <br>wiser than you?<br>Because you are greasy or pimpled, or that you <br>was once drunk, or a thief,<br>Or diseased, or rheumatic, or a prostitute, or are so <br>now;<br>Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no <br>scholar, and never saw your name in print,<br>Do you give in that you are any less immortal?</p><p>Whitman does not pretend to read 'the riddle of the painful earth;' but he takes leave to admire, after his fashion, the great Cosmos;</p><p>The sun and stars that float in the open air;<br>The apple-shaped earth, and we upon it—surely the<br> drift of them is something grand!<br>I do not know what it is, except that it is grand, <br>and that it is happiness,<br>And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a<br> speculation, or bon-mot, or reconnaissance,<br>And that it is not something which by luck may <br>turn out well for us, and without luck must be <br>a failure for us,<br>And not something which may yet be retracted in <br>a certain contingency.</p><p>Yet it is Man, and not external Nature, which has his worship:</p><p>When the psalm sings instead of the singer;<br>When the script preaches instead of the preacher;<br>When the pulpit descends and goes, instead of the <br>carver that carved the supporting desk;<br>When I can touch the body of books, by night or <br>by day, and when they touch my body back <br>again;<br>When a university course convinces, like a slumber-<br>ing woman and child convince;<br>When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the <br>night-watchman's daughter;<br>When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and <br>are my friendly companions;<br>I intend to reach them my hand, and make as <br>much of them as I do of men and women like <br>you.</p><p>The sum of all known reverence I add up in you, <br>whoever you are;<br>The President is there in the White House for you— <br>it is not you who are here for him.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>List close, my scholars dear!<br>All doctrines, all politics and civilisation, exsurge <br>from you;<br>All sculpture and monuments, and anything in-<br>scribed anywhere, are tallied in you;<br>The gist of histories and statistics, as far back as<br> the records reach, is in you this hour, and <br>myths and tales the same;<br>If you were not breathing and walking here, where <br>would they all be?<br>The most renowned poems would be ashes, orations <br>and plays would be vacuums.</p><p>Whitman is practical beyond all poets before him; and, indeed, in one sense (but not in the anti-theological one), material. It delights him to contemplate the visible instruments of labour, and he sings, in minutest detail, the works which they accomplish. The axe leaps, and the solid forest, says he, gives blind utterances, and the manifold shapes arise in his mind's eye, which are hewn out of the wood.</p><p>The coffin-shape for the dead to lie within in his <br>shroud;<br>The shape got out in posts, in the bedstead posts,<br> in the posts of the bride's bed;<br>The shape of the little trough, the shape of the <br>rockers beneath, the shape of the babe's cradle;<br>The shape of the floor-planks, the floor-planks for <br>dancers' feet;<br>The shape of the planks of the family home, the <br>home of the friendly parents and children,<br>The shape of the roof of the home of the happy<br> young man and woman, the roof over the well- <br>married young man and woman,<br>The roof over the supper joyously cooked by the <br>chaste wife, and joyously eaten by the chaste <br>husband, content after his day's work.</p><p>The shapes arise!<br>The shape of the prisoner's place in the court-room, <br>and of him or her seated in the place;<br>The shape of the liquor-bar leaned against by the <br>young rum-drinker and the old rum-drinker;<br>The shape of the shamed and angry stairs, trod by <br>sneaking footsteps;</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>The shape of the gambling-board with its devilish <br>winnings and losings;<br>The shape of the step-ladder for the convicted and <br>sentenced murderer, the murderer with haggard <br>face and pinioned arms.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>Shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances;<br>The door passing the dissevered friend, flushed and <br>in haste;<br>The door that admits good news and bad news;<br>The door whence the son left home, confident and <br>puffed up;<br>The door he entered again from a long and scandal- <br>ous absence, diseased, broken down, without <br>innocence, without means.</p><p>These picturings may be somewhat weird and fanciful, but they are expressed with power, and the conception of them is certainly original and striking. They are, however, too prolonged, and remind one of what somebody writes of the minuteness of Crabbe's verse—that he was like a broker appraising furniture.</p><p>Under the unsatisfactory title of 'Assimilations,' Whitman describes the influence of association upon the human mind, and, incidentally, depicts most graphically the surroundings and circumstances of the somewhat unenviable home in which he himself was reared.</p><p>The mother at home, quietly placing the dishes on <br>the supper-table;<br>The mother with mild words—clean her cap and <br>gown, a wholesome odour falling off her person <br>and clothes as she walks by;<br><em>The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, angered, unjust;<br>The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the <br>crafty lure,</em><br>The family usages, the language, the company, the <br>furniture—the yearning and swelling heart,<br>Affection that will not be gainsayed—the sense of <br> what is real—the thought if after all it should <br>prove unreal,<br>The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time <br>—the curious whether and how,<br>Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all<br> flashes and specks?<br>Men and women crowding fast in the streets—if <br>they are not flashes and specks, what are they?<br>The streets themselves, and the façades of houses, <br>and goods in the windows,<br>Vehicles, teams, the heavy-planked wharfs—the <br>huge crossing at the ferries,<br>The village on the highland, seen from afar at <br>sunset—the river between,<br>Shadows, aureola and mist, light falling on roofs <br>and gables of white or brown, three miles off,<br>The schooner near by, sleepily dropping down the <br>tide—the little boat slack-towed astern,<br>The hurrying tumbling waves quick-broken crests <br>slapping,<br>The strata of coloured clouds, the long bar of <br>maroon-tint, away solitary by itself—the spread <br>of purity it lies motionless in,<br>The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fra-<br>grance of salt-marsh and shore-mud:<br>These became part of that child who went forth<br> every day, and who now goes, and will always <br>go forth every day.</p><p>In Mr Rossetti's Preface, we learn in plain prose what Walt Whitman's life has been. Walt, it appears, is merely a characteristic appellation; he was named Walter, like his father before him, who was first a farmer, afterwards a carpenter and builder (hence, doubtless, that eulogy on the axe), and an adherent to the religious principles of 'the great Quaker iconoclast, Elias Hicks,' of whom, if our readers have never heard, they are no worse off than we are.</p><p>Walt—born in 1819—was schooled at Brooklyn, a suburb of New York, and began life at the age of thirteen, working as a printer, later on, as a country teacher, and then as a miscellaneous press-writer in New York.' He changed his pursuits, after the national fashion: became newspaper editor, and then builder, like his father; from 1837 to 1848, was, we fear, a rowdy, since his American biographer informs us that, during that period, 'he sounded all experiences of life, with all their passions, pleasures, and abandonments;' but in 1862, on the breaking out of the Civil War, he undertook the (gratuitous) service of nursing the wounded. He was a Northerner, of course, but the Southern sick were tended by him with equal care; 'the strongest testimony is borne to his self-devotion and kindliness;' and in a Washington hospital, when attending upon a case of gangrene, he absorbed the poison into his system, and was disabled for six months. In 1865, he obtained a clerkship in the Department of the Interior; but this was taken from him when he published his audacious Leaves of Grass. 'He soon after, however, obtained another modest, but creditable post in the office of the Attorney-general. He still visits the hospitals on Sundays, and often on other days as well.</p><p>The poet is 'much above the average size, and noticeably well-proportioned…. He has light-blue eyes, a florid complexion, a fleecy beard, now gray, and a quite peculiar sort of magnetism about him in relation to those with whom he comes in contact…. He has always been carried by predilection towards the society of the common people; but is not the less for that open to refined and artistic impressions.' As 'an accessible human individual,' he is thus described by a writer in theFortnightly Review: 'Having occasion to visit New York soon after the appearance of Walt Whitman's book, I was urged by some friends to search him out…. The day was excessively hot, the thermometer at nearly 100 , and the sun blazed down as only on sandy Long Island can the sun blaze…. I saw stretched upon his back, and gazing up straight at the terrible sun, the man I was seeking. With his gray clothing, his blue-gray shirt, his iron-gray hair, his swart sunburned face and bare neck, he lay upon the brown-and-white grass—for the sun had burned away its greenness—and was so like the earth upon which he rested that he seemed almost enough a part of it for one to pass by without recognition. I approached him, gave my name and reason for searching him out, and asked him if he did not find the sun rather hot. 'Not at all too hot,' was his reply; and he confided to me that this was one of his favourite places and attitudes for composing 'poems.' He then walked with me to his home, and took me along its narrow ways to his room. A small room of about fifteen feet square, with a single window looking out on the barren solitudes of the island; a small cot; a washstand, with a little looking-glass hung over it from a tack in the wall; a pine-table, with pen, ink, and paper on it; an old line-engraving, representing Bacchus, hung on the wall—and opposite, a similar one of Silenus: these constituted the visible environments of Walt Whitman. There was not, apparently, a single book in the room…. The books he seemed to know and love best were the Bible, Homer, and Shakespeare: these he owned, and probably had in his pockets while we were talking. He had two studies where he read: one was the top of an omnibus; and the other a small mass of sand, then entirely uninhabited, far out in the ocean, called Coney Island…. The only distinguished contemporary he had ever met was the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, of Brooklyn, who had visited him…. He confessed to having no talent for industry, and that his forte was 'loafing and writing poems:' he was poor, but had discovered that he could, on the whole, live magnificently on bread and water…. On no occasion did he laugh, nor indeed did I ever see him smile.'</p><p>If he does not laugh, he is humorous enough in his poems, although, it may be, without being aware of it. Under the head of Wonders—and if he has the bump of Wonder, I am afraid he has not that of Veneration—he thus discourses:</p><p>The great laws take and effuse without argument;<br>I am of the same style, for I am their friend,<br>I love them quits and quits—I do not halt and <br>make salaams.<br>I lie abstracted, and hear beautiful tales of things, <br>and the reasons of things;<br><em>They are so beautiful, I nudge myself to listen.</em><br>I cannot say to any person what I hear—I cannot <br>say it to myself—it is very wonderful.</p><P>The notion of nudging one's self to listen is capital, but suggests that there may be a tinge of Irish-American in Mr Walt Whitman's otherwise pur sang (as he would term it). Here is something which, while reminding one in its form of Mr Martin Tupper, would, if the idea should be attributed to him, give that respectable gentleman a fit:</p><p>Of detected persons—To me, detected persons are <br>not in any respect worse than undetected per-<br>sons—and are not in any respect worse than <br>I am myself.<br>Of criminals—To me, any judge, or any juror, is <br>equally criminal—and any reputable person also— <br>and the President is also.</p><p>We cannot more fitly conclude our notice of this really remarkable man than by quoting his most characteristic poem. It is from the Leaves of Grass, and is called Burial. It expresses very strikingly in his strange rhythm the thought that has struck most of us who have any egotism. How strange that the world should have wagged on for ages before we came into it, and how still stranger (and more audacious) that it will still continue to wag on, when we have ceased to wag.</p><p>To think of it!<br>To think of time—of all that retrospection!<br>To think of to-day, and the ages continued hence- <br>forward!</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>To think that the sun rose in the east! that men <br>and women were flexible, real, alive! that <br>everything was alive!<br>To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, <br>nor bear our part!<br>To think that we are now here, and bear our part!<br>Not a day passes—not a minute or second, without <br>an accouchement!<br>Not a day passes—not a minute or second, without <br>a corpse!<br>The dull nights go over, and the dull days also;<br>The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over;<br>The physician, after long putting off, gives the <br>silent and terrible lookfor an answer;<br>The children come hurried and weeping, and the <br>brothers and sisters are sent for;<br>Medicines stand unused on the shelf (the camphor- <br>smell has long pervaded the rooms);<br>The faithful hand of the living does not desert the <br>hand of the dying;<br>The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of <br>the dying;<br>The breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases;<br>The corpse stretches on the bed, and the living look upon it;<br>It is palpable as the living are palpable.</p><p>The living look upon the corpse with their eye- <br>sight,<br>But without eyesight lingers a different living, and <br>looks curiously on the corpse.<br>To think that the rivers will flow, and the snow <br>fall, and the fruits ripen, and act upon others <br>as upon us now—yet not act upon us!<br>To think of all these wonders of city and country, <br>and others taking great interest in them—and <br>we taking no interest in them!<br>To think how eager we are in building our houses! <br>To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite <br>indifferent!</p><p>The poet considers the universalness of this thing called Death</p><p>Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole <br>earth…they never cease…they are the burial- <br>lines;<br>He that was President was buried, and he that is <br>now President shall surely be buried.</p><p>But the particular illustration which Walt Whitman characteristically selects of Burial is by no means that of the President, but of an old Broadway stage-driver. It is so graphic, that it might be a sketch by Dickens, and yet it has a weird sort of rhythm about it that separates it from prose of any sort:</p><p>Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf—posh and <br>ice in the river, half-frozen mud in the streets, a <br>gray discouraged sky overhead, the short last <br>day-light of Twelfth-month;<br>A hearse and stages—other vehicles give place— <br>the funeral of an old Broadway stage-driver, <br>the cortège mostly drivers.</p><p>Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the <br>death-bell, the gate is passed, the new-dug <br>grave is halted at, the living alight, the hearse <br>uncloses,<br>The coffin is passed out, lowered and settled, the <br>whip is laid on the coffin, the earth is swiftly <br>shovelled in,<br>The mound above is flatted with the spades—silence;<br>A minute, no one moves or speaks—it is done;<br>He is decently put away—is there anything more?</p><p>He was a good fellow, free-mouthed, quick-tem- <br>pered, not bad-looking, able to take his own <br>part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with <br>life or death for a friend, fond of women, <br>gambled, ate hearty, drank hearty, had known<br> what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited <br>toward the last, sickened, was helped by a <br>contribution, died, aged forty-one years—and <br>that was his funeral.<br>Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, <br>strap, wet-weather clothes, whip carefully <br>chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody<br> loafing on you, you loafing on somebody, head-<br>way, man before and man behind, good day's <br>work, bad day's work, pet stock, mean stock, <br>first out, last out, turning-in at night;<br>To think that these are so much and so nigh to <br>other drivers—and he there takes no interest <br>in them!</p><p>∗ Poems by Walt Whitman.

The Kosmos hailed from America, and was introduced to the reader in a frontispiece which represented an unkempt, dishevelled person in long hair and impossible eyes, crowned with a wide-awake hat. This picturesque ruffian announced himself as 'of the Manahatta, singing thereof, and no less in myself than the whole of Manahatta in itself.' In order to make himself and his mission still clearer to the minds of men, he thus spoke in his preface:—</p><p>'This is what you shall do: love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labour to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence towards the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown, or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the young, and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, re-examine all you have been told at school, or church, or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul; and your very flesh shall be a great poem, and have the richest fluency, not only in its words, but in the silent lines of its lips and face, and between the lashes of your eyes, and in every motion and joint of your body.'</p><p>Unimpressed by these warnings, the critics scoffed at Leaves of Grass. They could not discover that the Kosmos wrote either poetry or sense. They could perceive that he was obscene, filthy, and blasphemous—that he knew his filth and revelled in it—calling upon us to admire in him that which was most nasty—shouting and gibbering like an ill-conditioned chimpanzee. What small gleams of meaning there lay in these simious utterances was the veriest commonplace, the baldest platitude. In fact, the critics declared that this new poet from beyond the seas was but a wild and inflated Tupper, that he was nebulous only because he had no meaning, that even when most distinct he was incoherent, and that altogether it was a very foolish and dull sort of monster.</p><p>Mr. W. M. Rosetti calls upon us now with much gravity to reverse all these judgments. Walt Whitman, we are told, is not a man to be overlooked. Walt Whitman is a true seer, a most subtle and profound poet. Rough he may be, but he is the child of Nature. Wild he may be, but he is the Spirit of the Young World. In Walt Whitman we are called upon to recognise 'the founder of American poetry rightly to be so called, and the most sonorous poetic voice of the tangibilities of actual and prospective democracy.' Before Walt Whitman we are called upon to bow, as the genius of the Future, the expounder of the To Be. As for Mr. Rosetti, who, in other respects, is a sensible and decent man, and a delicate and acute critic; he is overwhlemed with the contemplation of this huge, blurred figure of a Titan which rises out of chaos. He prostrates himself before the uncouth image of Whitman, just as a Hindoo grovels before Siva. In the writings of Walt Whitman Mr. Rosetti discovers 'a waif of prose amid the weft of poetry, such as Shakespeare himself furnishes the precedent for in drama.' Evidently Mr. Rosetti is only restrained by a feeling of delicacy towards public opinion from pronouncing Whitman a much greater man than Shakespeare. 'The entire book' (Leaves of Grass) he declares to be 'the poem of the natural man, not of the merely physical, still less of the disjunctively intellectual or spiritual man, but of him who, being a man first and foremost, is therein also a spirit and an intellect.' Certainly, nothing like this could be said of poor William Shakespeare. He was but a small creature, and never wrote anything like 'a poem of the natural man.' Of the disjunctively intellectual, it is probable that an English bard had but the dimmest notion. He was all very well for his time, but he was not a Kosmos. It is probable that he never thought of a 'mission' at all, and we are very sure that he received no hint in his soul of 'the tangibilities of actual and prospective democracy.'</p><p>By way of showing us what a superior animal is this American poet, Mr. Rosetti has given us a selection of his works, with which he has taken what we must consider the unwarrantable liberty of cutting out all the blasphemies and obscenities. Surely this is but scurvy treatment for the poet of the Future. Surely the pæan of the natural man' ought to be given to us entire, as the prophet himself delivered it. What right has Mr. Rosetti to blurt and spoil the great message which is intended for our salvation? The excuse that an editor gives for leaving out about one-half of what Walt Whitman really wrote, and for dressing up the remainder with headings and cutting it into arbitrary lengths, we must hold to be very insufficient. Mr. Rosetti tells us that he has omitted 'every poem which could with any tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings of morals or propriety in this peculiarly nervous age'—which is but a clumsy way of serving either the poet or the age. Surely a Kosmos knows better than Mr. Rosetti what is best for the age. The pæan of the natural man, to be of any value, should be given in the singer's own words. How are we to judge of whole man Whitman if we are to see only the most decent part of him? Those who are acquainted with Leaves of Grass in their original form know that it is this very indecency and bold out-speaking upon which Walt Whitman prides himself—which are his claims to the Kosmical distinction. We presume it is not by school-girls that Whitman's place in literature is to be fixed. Why then this foolish and insulting squeamishness?</p><p>How the purged and shaved Whitman looks under Mr. Rosetti's hands we can best show by specimens of his poetry. Here is one passage, which we are led to believe is a favourable sample of our poet's quality, which may be supposed to be valuable as explaining the 'tangibilities of the prospective democracy':—</p><p>'Democracy!<br>Near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully singing.<br>Ma femme!<br>For the brood beyond us and of us,<br>For those who belong here, and those to come,<br>I, exultant, to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon the earth,<br>I will make the songs of passion, to give them their way,<br>And your songs, outlawed offenders—for I scan you with kindred eyes, and carry you with me the same as any.<br>I will make the true poem of riches,—<br>To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres, and goes forward, and is not dropped by death.<br>I will effuse egotism, and show it underlying all—and I will be the bard of personality;<br>And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the other;<br>And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present—and can be none in the future;<br>And I will show that, whatever happens to anybody, it may be turned to beautiful results—and I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death;<br>And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are compact,<br>And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each as profound as any.<br>I will not make poems with reference to parts;<br>But I will make leaves, poems, poemets, songs, says, thoughts, with reference to ensemble;<br>And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to all days;<br>And I will not make a poem, nor the least part of a poem, but has reference to the soul;<br>Because, having looked at the objects of the universe, I hold there is no one, nor any particle of one, but has reference to the soul.'</p><p>To those who may still hold that the tangibilities of democracy are a little hazy we can give no consolation. If they will not believe Mr. Rosetti they will not believe Walt Whitman, who sent him. The poetry of the future may be considered to be slightly wanting both in rhythm and reason; but those who make this objection are vulgar persons to whom the vision has never come. They are only to be pitied and passed by—according to Mr. Rosetti. To the enlightened few it will be only necessary to quote such a passage as this, and all is clear:—</p><p><em>'WHEREFORE?</em><br>O me! O life! . . . of the questions of those recurring;<br>Of the endless trains of the faithless—of cities filled with the foolish;<br>Of myself for ever reproaching myself (for who more foolish than I and who more faithless?);<br>Of eyes that vainly crave the light—of the objects mean—of the struggle ever renewed;<br>Of the poor results of all—of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me;<br>Of the empty and useless years of the rest—with the rest me intertwined;<br>The question, O me! so sad, recurring,—What good amid these, O me, O life?'</p><p><em>'ANSWER.</em><br>'That you are here—that life exists, and identity;<br>That the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse.'<br>And part of another poem is as follows:—<br>'The workmanship of souls is by the inaudible words of the earth;<br>The great masters know the earth's words, and use them more than the audible words,<br>Amelioration is one of the earth's words;<br>The earth neither lags nor hastens;<br>It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump;<br>It is not half beautiful only—defects and excrescences show just as much as perfections show,<br>The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough;<br>The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so concealed either;<br>They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print;<br>They are imbued through all things, conveying themselves willingly,<br>Conveying a sentiment and invitation of the earth. I utter and utter:<br>I speak not, yet if you hear me not, of what avail am I to you?<br>To bear—to better; lacking these, of what avail am I?<br>Accouche! Accouchez!<br>Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?<br>Will you squat and stifle there?<br>The earth does not argue,<br>Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,<br>Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,<br>Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,<br>Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,<br>Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out.<br>The earth does not exhibit itself, nor refuse to exhibit itself—posesses still underneath;<br>Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the wail of slaves,<br>Persuasions of lovers, curses, gaps of the dying, laughter of young people, accents of bargainers,<br>Underneath these, possessing the words that never fail.<br>To her children, the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail;<br>The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail, and reflection does not fail;<br>Also the day and night do not fail, and the voyage we pursue does not fail.'</p><p>According to one of Walt Whitman's admirers, this is one of those portions of the work by which we perceive that 'life is everything, that man is an integral part of the world's life, and that it is by the full unfolding of man's powers that life is ennobled and the world made beautiful.' After this, may we not put in a claim for our own Tupper? Has he not written to show that 'life is everything,' and that 'man is an integral part of the world's life?' What is the burden of our latter-day Solomon, if not that it is by the full unfolding of a man's powers that life is to be ennobled? It is true that our Tupper does not violate the decencies, nor call himself a Kosmos. But surely it is but a dissolute and an inebriate Tupper who writes most of the lines which Mr. Rosetti so admires. What shall we say to this, for instance:—</p><p>'All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it;<br>Did you think it was in the white or grey stone? or the lines of the arches and cornices?<br>All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded by the instruments.'</p><p>Or in a higher key and in the most prophetic manner this, which really contains the only gem of a poetic idea which to our common understandings is perceptible in Walt Whitman:—</p><p>'What whispers are these, O lands, running ahead of you, passing under the seas?<br>Are all nations communing? Is there going to be but one heart to the globe?<br>Is humanity forming en masse?—for lo! tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim;<br>The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war;<br>No one knows what will happen next—such portents fill the days and nights;<br>Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to pierce it, is full of phantoms;<br>Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me;<br>This incredible rush and heat, this strange ecstatic fever of dreams, O years!<br>Your dreams, O years, how they penetrate through me! (I know not whether I sleep or wake!)<br>The performed American and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me;<br>The unperformed, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me.'</p><p>We are entreated to give this kind of thing a patient hearing, and are asked to recognise it as at least a real voice arising out of the motion of the universe. It may be that Walt Whitman is a true poet and that to him is given the key which is to unlock the secret of the future. If so, we can only say that the world has been all wrong as to what constitutes poetry. If Walt Whitman is a poet, then we have greatly to enlarge the circle of Parnassus, and to make easy the way to the summit. If to discharge one's imagination of all the crude shapes which gather there be to write poetry, then there are some thousands who have only to print what comes apparent to their mind to earn the title of seer. Let it be cut into lengths, with a capital letter at the beginning of each length, and lo! it is a poem. Neither rhyme nor reason is required, and very little decency. One has but to secure an editor like Mr. W. M. Rosetti, and the world is made acquainted with a new poet.</p><p>In the present instance it will require more than Mr. Rosetti's authority, we fear, to make Walt Whitman an acceptable poet to the multitude. However familiar with the future, he is likely to remain a sealed book to the present. This cannot be, of course, any disadvantage to a Kosmos—a Manahatta—a professor of the Tangibilities of Democracy—a singer of the pæan of natural life. Being all these things, Walt Whitman can afford to wait, and it is highly probable that to wait will be his only alternative.</p><p>———</p><p>*'Poems by Walt Whitman.' Selected and edited by W. M.
