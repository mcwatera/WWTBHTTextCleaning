<p>'LEAVES OF GRASS.'</p><p>———</p><p>The Complete Poems of Walt Whitman</p><p>———</p><p>As Published by a Famous Boston House.</p><p>———</p><p>A Friendly Characterization of the Poet's Work.</p><p>When a great man gets ahead of the world he has but to wait quietly and the world will come around to where he is. When Walt Whitman was welcomed to Olympus a quarter of a century ago, his greatness was as secure as it is today, when he is acknowledged by the people whose greatness inspires his verse. In all quarters of the Union, North, South, East and West, Walt Whitman has the warmest personal friends who, if they have not met him face to face, have felt the grasp of his hand in his words. No other man has expressed his personality so strongly in his poems. One of the best characterizations of 'Leaves of Grass' is that of a lady, who said: 'It does not read like a book; it seems like a man.' The publication of the complete poems of Walt Whitman by one of the leading publishers of the United States is a literary event, for through it the greatest American poet has come to the birthright denied him so long. It has, indeed, mattered little to him, for he has bided his time patiently and serenely, and when such captains of the mind as Emerson and Tennyson reached out their hands in friendly recognition, he could rest satisfied that the multitude would some day acknowledge the prophet hailed by those leaders. The date of the following lines seem remote enough:</p><p>CONCORD, Mass., July. 1855.</p><p>Dear Sir: I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of the 'Leaves of Grass.' I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed. I am very happy in reading it as great power makes us happy. It meets the demand I am always making of what seemed the sterile and stingy nature, as if too much handiwork or too much lymph in the temperament were making our western wits fat and mean. I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things said incomparably well as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.</p><p>I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere for such a stint. I rubbed my eyes a little to see if this sunbeam were no illusion, but the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging. I did not know, until I last night saw the book advertised in a newspaper, that I could trust the name as real and available for the postoffice. I wish to see my benefactor, and have felt much like striking my tasks and visiting New York to pay you my respects.</p><p>R. W. Emerson.</p><p>Though these words were afterward somewhat taken back—a little Galileo-like, through fear of the New England pope called prudery—it was the true Emerson who spoke his heart then. 'Leaves of Grass' have been harvested several times and bound in sheaves of various form, from the quaint first edition, which was both body and soul, the work of Walt Whitman, to that of the New York Publisher who was so frightened at what he had done that he</p><p><em>BACKED OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE;</em></p><p>that of the Boston publisher, which has been the standard for many years because of the implied demand; the personal edition published by the poet himself; one or more of the English editions, and now at last the edition just published by James R. Osgood & Co., a compact volume of 382 pages, with all the elements of attractive typography, binding form and price needed for the great popular success which the work is sure to achieve. That beside its assured hearty reception the book will be much maligned and ridiculed is a matter of course, for as it is read more so will there be more opposition to its lessons. But it is a test of greatness that ridicule it as much as you will, the ridicule will not stick. Walt Whitman has survived the great storms that have assailed him and his fame is secure from the pattering of little showers.</p><p>The new edition contains all his poems; the only changes that have been made are in the way of condensation of utterance. There are, also, something like 20 new poems printed direct from the manuscript. There is more of a rounding and completeness of the work; the all embracing patriotism which forms one of the poet's grandest characteristics is more comprehensive than ever before manifested. Walt Whitman did yeoman service for the Union in the hospitals of the field during the war, and he loves the whole Union. He has a warm place in his heart for the South, and it is manifested on many pages of this new edition. He writes:</p><p>'I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the <br>wise,<br>Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,<br>Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,<br>Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with <br>stuff that is fine.<br>One of the nation of many nations, the smallest the same <br>and the largest the same,<br>A southerner soon as a northerner.'</p><p>The titles of a number of poems have been changed, notably that of the great poem of the work, that which strikes the key note of the volume, 'Walt Whitman,' being now known as 'Song of Myself.' At the beginning of this song is a portrait of the poet as he was when 'Leaves of Grass' was gestating, a steel engraving from an old daguerreotype taken in 1856 when Walt Whitman was 37 years old. He was then a carpenter, building and selling cottage houses in Brooklyn, and the picture was taken impromptu one warm June afternoon by Gabriel Harrison. The picture is well described by the lines:</p><p>'Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I <br>am,<br>Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, <br>unitary,<br>Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpa-<br>ble certain rest.<br>Looking with side-curved head curious what will come <br>next.<br>Both in and out of the game, and watching and wondering <br>at it.'</p><p><em>THE OLD OBJECTIONS</em></p><p>will, of course, be brought up. Many will say they agree with the ideas, but what is the use of printing them in the shape of poetry? Because it reads better that way, and it is poetry of the noblest kind, may be answered. Why is it that so many still insist that conventional form is necessary to poetry? Do they admire flowers most, or the vase? In Milton's day many maintained that 'Paradise Lost' was not a poem because it was not in rhyme. In the 'Leaves of Grass' the blades are of unequal length, but they are ever fresh and beautiful, and full of sweet nutriment. Thought, and truth, and strength, and nobility, and grand proportions, whose symmetry belittles inequalities of metre, are all there, and rhythmic swing is there. Is anything more needed for poetry?</p><p>One of the great features of Walt Whitman is that he does not seek his ideals in far away times, which stripped of their glamour of, remoteness, are but as the times of today; or, in supreme moments, he idealizes the commonplace, and has the clearness of vision that discerns the gleam of gold through all the accumulated dross.</p><p>The large and the magnificent tolerance that includes all and allows for all, and finds a place for all, is a sublime characteristic of the man. There is so much in these lines that they cannot be packed into layers of equal length. The book teems with the ecstasy of being. The statement of details into which the poet now and then drops has been criticised as 'cataloging.' But viewed with the poet's intention, what a mosaic picture of the people, of the nation and its races, is thus constituted! One sees the stir and hears the hum of the entire land; feels the pulse of the multitude. What is the use of attempting to depict such a thing—it can't be all shown. But the effect is like a gleam of sunshine in the depths of a forest; it reveals many things with vivid distinctness; there is a vast reserve of hidden things which might be seen, but enough is shown to tell what is there—to give the character of the place. Do not these fragments, picked from different parts of the country, at random, give an idea of what the life of that country is:</p><p>'The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the <br>wharf or levee,<br>As the wooly-pates hoe in the sugar field, the over-<br>seer views them from his saddle.<br>The bugle calls in the bedroom, the gentlemen run for <br>their partners, the dancers bow to each other.<br>The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret and <br>harks to the musical rain,<br>The wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill <br>the Huron.<br>The squaw, wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth, is offer-<br>ing mocassin and bead bars for sale,<br>The connoisseur peers along the exhibition gallery, <br>with half-shut eyes bent sideways.'</p><p><em>THE WANT OF ARTISTIC GRACE</em></p><p>in form is compensated for by the artistic picturesqueness of form; in a measure, the poet makes pictures of his poems, and thus strengthens their individuality. For instance, the frequent use of italics and parentheses and the choice of odd words now and then—a bit of Spanish or French. Camerado and Libertad are favorites. These foreign words and phrases seem to depict unassimilated fragments floating on the life-current of the nation.</p><p>Many intelligent people fail to comprehend; they can't see what the poet is driving at—it is all so strange and unwanted, or unlike previous models. They get too close to the canvass; they see nothing but paint and brush marks; they do not take it all in—they do not see the picture. What a daring use of color! Only a strong man could wield such a brush. Should a weaker man attempt such bold figures; he would make himself ridiculous; it would seem like affectation, as it would should he wear unconventional dress. But Walt Whitman can carry it off. He looks exceeding well in his broad hat, wide collar and suit of modest gray. We all want more freedom of movement, but he can afford to take it and is not afraid. Read this vivid description of a sunrise:</p><p>'To behold the day-break!<br>The little light fades the immense and diaphanous <br>shadows.<br>The air tastes good to my palate.<br>Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently <br>rising freshly exuding,<br>Scooting obliquely high and low.<br>Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous <br>prongs,<br>Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.'</p><p>And this from one of the many pictures of death:</p><p>'And as to you, corpse, I think you are good manure, <br>but that does not offend me.<br>I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing.<br>I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts<br> of melons.'</p><p>There is much that will not be understood by many, much to which many will object, but as willing guests who approach a beautifully spread table, upon which are dishes which some like and dislike, and others again can learn to like—there is enough of grandeur and beauty and truth, so that every body can</p><p><em>TAKE AWAY SOMETHING TO HIS TASTE.</em></p><p>The poems are not to be accepted too literally, and the poet understood to be doing or wishing to do everything which is spoken of under the cover of the first person—he simply expresses his capacity to feel universally; he impersonates all humanity in himself, puts himself in its place, and surveys the universe from his standpoint—as everyone is to himself the central point of the world.</p><p>'I do not say these things for a dollar, or to fill up the <br>time while I wait for a boat,<br>(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the <br>tongue of you,<br>Tied in your mouth in mine it begins to be loosen'd).'</p><p>Walt Whitman is the poet of evolution—modern science finds its prophet in him. He conjoins materialism with ideality. He is religious in the largest sense.</p><p>'Each is not for its own sake,<br>I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are <br>for religion's sake.</p><p>I say no man has ever been half devout enough,<br>None has ever yet adored or worship'd half enough,<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, <br>and how certain the future is.'</p><p>The course of the 'Song of Myself' is like that of a noble drama, and it has the sublimest moments in its culmination. How sound physical health asserts itself here:</p><p>'I think I could turn and live with animals, they are<br>so placid and self-contain'd,<br>I stand and look at them long and long.</p><p>They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their <br>sins.<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty to <br>God,<br>Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the <br>mania of owning things.<br>Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived <br>thousands of years ago.<br>Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole <br>earth.'</p><p>What an omnisciently inspired and sustained note in the passages beginning with the following:</p><p>'I heard what was said of the universe,<br>I heard it and heard it of several thousand years;<br>It is middling well as far as it goes—but is that all!</p><p>Magnifying and applying come I,<br>Outbidding at the start the old cautions hucksters,<br>Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,<br>Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his <br>grandson.<br>Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,<br>In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf,<br> the crucifix engraved.<br>With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every <br>idol and image,<br>Taking them all for what they are worth and not a <br>cent more.'</p><p>'I do not despise you priest, all time, the world over,<br>My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of <br>faiths.<br>Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between <br>ancient and modern.'</p><p>'Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like <br>cheerful boatmen.<br>For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings.<br>They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.<br>Before I was born out of my mother generations <br>guided me.<br>My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could <br>overlay it.<br>For it the nebula cohered to an orb,<br>The long, slow strata piled to rest it on.<br>Vast vegetables gave it sustenance.<br>Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and <br>deposited it with care.</p><p>All forces have been steadily employed to complete <br>and delight me,<br>Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.'</p><p><em>WAS EVER THE COURSE OF CREATION</em></p><p>more concisely and grandly stated? Does it not make old fables turn pale? It is a lofty height from which all this is said down to the world. Taking the national side of the poet, were the local names ever more truthfully or poetically expressed than in the following:</p><p>'The red aborigines,<br>Leaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds, <br>calls as of birds and animals in the woods, syllabled to us <br>for names.<br>Okonee, Koosa, Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez,<br> Chattahoochee, Kaqueta, Oronoco,<br>Wabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, Oshkosh, Walla- <br>Walla.<br>Leaving such to the States they melt, they depart, <br>charging the water and the land with names.'</p><p>It is interesting to note some of the favorite passages of the poet's most eminent admirers. The lines previously quoted, 'I heard what was said of the universe,' are especially admired by J. T. Trowbridge, who knows them by heart. The favorite passage of the late Prof. Clifford, the Englishman, who was one of the first to introduce the poet to transatlantic audiences were the glowing lines to night:</p><p>'I am he that walks with the tender and growing<br> night,<br>I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.<br>Press close bare-bosom'd night—press close magnetic <br>nourishing night!<br>Night of south winds—night of the large few stars!<br>Still nodding night—mad naked summer night.</p><p>Smile, O voluptuous cool-breathed earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains<br>misty-topt!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just <br>tinged with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer <br>for my sake!<br>Far swooping elbow'd earth—rich apple-blossom'd <br>earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes.</p><p>Prodigal you have given me love—therefore, I to you <br>give love!<br>O unspeakable passionate love.'</p><p>The favorite poem of Charles Sumner was the first one under the head of 'Sea Drift,' the idyl of sunny loveliness, called 'Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking.' The poem is too long to quote here, but here is one of its lyrics, the song of two mated birds, 'Two Feathered Guests from Alabama':</p><p>Shine! shine! shine!<br>Pour down your warmth great sun!<br>While we bask, we two together.</p><p>Two together!<br>Winds blow south, or winds blow north.<br>Day come white, or night come black,<br>Home, or rivers and mountains from home,<br>Singing all time, minding all time,<br>While we two keep together.</p><p>Of the poems here collected for the first time that written in Platte canon, Colorado, amid its awful ruggedness and grandeur, is a magnificent justification of the poet's methods:</p><p>Spirit that form'd this scene,<br>These tumbled rock-piles grim and red,<br>These reckless heaven-ambitious peaks,<br>These gorges, turbulent-clear streams, this naked <br>freshness.<br>These formless wild arrays, for reasons of their own,<br>I know thee, savage spirit—we have communed to-<br>gether.<br>Mine too such wild arrays, for reasons of their own.<br>Was't charged against my chants they had forgotten <br>art?<br>To fuse within themselves its rules precise and delica <br>tesse?<br>The lyrist's measur'd beat, the wrought-out temple's <br>grace—column and polish'd arch forgot?<br>But thou that revelest here—spirit that form'd this <br>scene,<br>They have remember'd thee.</p><p><em>IN 'ITALIAN MUSIC IN DAKOTA'</em></p><p>a charming picture is given of the effect of music on a quiet evening at a solitary frontier post. All familiar with the plains will respond to the chord here struck:</p><p>Through the soft evening air enwinding all,<br>Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless <br>wilds.<br>In dulcet streams in flutes' and cornets' notes,<br>Electric, pensive, turbulent, artificial.<br>(Yet strangely fitting even here, meanings unknown <br>before,<br>Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here, re-<br>lated here,<br>Not to the city's frescoed rooms, not to the audience <br>of the opera house.<br>Sounds echoes, wandering strains, as really here at <br>home.<br>Sonnambula's innocent love, trios with Norma's an-<br>guish.<br>And thy ecstatic chorus, Poliuto;)<br>Ray'd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,<br>Music, Italian music in Dakota.<br>While Nature, sovereign of this gnarl'd realm,<br>Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses,<br>Acknowledging rapport, however far removed,<br>(As some old root or soil of earth its last-born flower <br>or fruit).<br>Listens well pleas'd.</p><p>In the lines to Gen. Grant, returned from his world's tour, he says that what best he sees in him is not the tribute paid to him, but that in his walks with kings the prairie sovereigns of the West, 'Invisibly with thee walking with kings with even pace the round world's promenade, were all so justified.' Others of these new poems, full of beauty, are 'Thou orb aloft full dazzling' (which was rejected by a leading editor last summer, on the ground that his readers would not understand it), 'To the Man-of-War Bird,' 'Patrolling Barnegat,' 'My Picture Gallery,' 'The Prairie States,' a tribute to Custer's memory called 'From far Dakota's canons,' 'A Riddle Song,' inspired by the mystery of life, and the following tender, reverential lines to his mother's memory:</p><p><em>AS AT THY PORTALS ALSO, DEATH.</em></p><p>As at thy portals also, death.<br>Entering thy sovereign, dim, illimitable grounds.<br>To memories of my mother, to the divine blending, <br>maternity,<br>To her, buried and gone, yet buried not, gone not from <br>me,<br>(I see again the calm benignant face, fresh and <br>beautiful still,<br>I sit by the form in the coffin.<br>I kiss, and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips,<br> the cheeks, the closed eyes in the coffin).<br>To her, the ideal woman, practical, spiritual, of all of<br> earth, life, love, to me the best,<br>I grave a monumental line before I go, amid these songs,<br>And set a tombstone here.</p><p>Face to face with lines which approach the grave with such classic nobility of step, who can say that Walt Whitman is not a poet? A thoughtful writer of German birth and education, but living today in America, has said that some of the main features and themes of 'Leaves of Grass' may be designated as individuality, inevitable law, physical health, modernness, open air nature, democracy, comradeship, the indissoluble union, good will to other lands, respect to the past, grandeur of labor, perfect state equality, with modernness like a canopy over all, and a resumption of the old Greek ideas of nudity and the divinity of the body, with the Hebrew sacredness of paternity, while the war, the sea, the night, the south and poems of death are also frequently recurring themes. His treatment of the last mentioned theme is specially notable in the 'Memories of President Lincoln.' In the stately elegy which begins these memories, 'When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed,' the threading of the theme shows a high dramatic instinct. As the singer walks the night with the knowledge of death and the thought of death as companions, the warble of the gray-brown bird singing in the swamp the song of death pervades it all. The notes recur like the motive of a symphony, and at last</p><p><em>THE SONG BREAKS FORTH:</em></p><p>Come lovely and soothing death,<br>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriv-<br>ing,<br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>Sooner or later, delicate death.<br>Prais'd be the fathomless universe.<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curi-<br>ous,<br>And for love, sweet love—but praise! praise! praise!<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.<br>Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, <br>come unfalteringly.</p><p>The foregoing lines are but a part of the bird song. Another song on the death of Lincoln, 'Oh Captain! My Captain!' is already established as a popular American classic.</p><p>The poet Stedman, in a recent article, used the unfortunate expression that his appreciative criticism on 'Walt Whitman,' printed in Scribner's some months ago, was churlishly received. The writer chances to know that Mr. Stedman has somehow sadly misapprehended the state of the case. Mr. Whitman has the warmest personal regard for Mr. Stedman, of whom he speaks with a genuine liking, and he felt the real worth of Mr. Stedman's article, but he also felt that Mr. Stedman had failed to grasp the wholeness of the work, though no finer characterization of the parts could be found. 'Leaves of Grass' is a kosmos, and the leaving out of that which Mr. Stedman, in common with many, finds objectionable, would make it like an imperfect body. One of the greatest of living authors, in speaking with the writer about that passage in Mr. Stedman's article, where it was stated that nature always covered up her bare and ugly spots, and that, therefore, such did not belong in the field of poetry, said that there were times when nature was bare and ugly, that it was the province of art to be truthful to nature, and that genius could treat these themes without offence. In all Walt Whitman there is no more evil thought than in the sprouting of a bud or the wafting of pollen on the wings of springtime. Fortunately it is based upon a law more stable than the fickle suffrages of the multitude, or the wishes of those who would have had him write differently, and, therefore, but partially true.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN.</p><p>———</p><p>The Man and His Book—Some New Gems for His Admirers.</p><p>The 'good grey poet' but a few days since left Boston, where he has been for some weeks past staying and busying himself with revising the proof-sheets of the new edition of his famous book, 'Leaves of Grass,' which is soon to be issued by James R. Osgood & Co. of this city. Mr. Whitman, though now nearly 68 years of age, is still hale and vigorous, both in body and mind. The shock of paralysis which he sometime ago experienced still causes him some inconvenience, but does not prevent his moving about, and his striking face and imposing figure, in its somewhat odd dress, has become quite familiar to people of the West End, where he has resided. All who came in contact with the venerable poet were charmed by his cheery kindness, his wit and humor and his intelligent conversation. He has by no means ceased to write, and during the last two or three weeks of his stay in Boston produced several new pieces, which will appear for the first time in the new edition of his poems. Mr. Whitman is eminently the poet of passing events. He does not seek for a grand subject for his muse, but being of a poetic nature he sees the poetry that exists in events almost commonplace. They suggest a poetic thought, and he gives it expression in his own peculiar style. In fact, the most of his short poems are but the expression of a single thought. As an illustration of Mr. Whitman's grasping an idea, may be instanced his poem, entitled, 'The Sobbing of the Bells,' first published in the POST. Mr. Whitman was awakened by the tolling of the bells announcing the death of President Garfield. He appreciated the pathos of the event, and rising, wrote the few lines which so beautifully expressed the sentiment, and which have already become famous. Mr. Whitman's poems have been severely criticized, but much of the criticism is due to a failure to understand. Whether his peculiar style of expression is to be commended or not may be a question, but the beauty of the thoughts expressed cannot be denied. Among the new poems to appear in the volume we take the privilege of quoting a few. The following lines, suggested by hearing a regimental band in the wilds of the far west, is another illustration of Mr. Whitman's ability to see the poetry of ordinary events:</p><p><em>ITALIAN MUSIC IN DAKOTA.</em></p><p>['The Seventeenth—the finest Regimental band I<br> ever heard.']<br>Through the soft evening air enwinding all,<br>Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless <br>wilds,<br>In dulcet streams, in flutes' and cornets' notes,<br>Electric, pensive, turbulent, artificial,<br>(Yet strangely fitting even here, meaning unknown <br>before.<br>Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here,<br>related here,<br>Not to the city's fresco'd rooms, not to the audience<br>of the opera house.<br>Sounds, echoes, wandering strains, as really here at<br>home,<br>Sonnambula's innocent love, trios with Norma's an-<br>guish,<br>And thy ecstatic chorus Pelinto;)<br>Ray'd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,<br>Music, Italian music in Dakota.</p><p>While nature, sovereign of this gnarl'd realm,<br>Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses,<br>Acknowledging rapport however far remove'd,<br>(As some old root or soul of earth its last-born <br>flower or fruit),<br>Listens well pleas'd.</p><p>Another, a bit of description, is in a style well adapted to the grand scene described.</p><p><em>SPIRIT THAT FORM'D THIS SCENE.</em></p><p>[Written in Platte Canon, Colorado.]<br>Spirit that form'd this scene,<br>These tumbled rock piles grim and red,<br>These reckless heaven-ambitious peaks,<br>These gorges, turbulent clear streams, this naked<br>freshness.<br>These tormices wild arrays, for reasons of their own,<br>I know thee, savage spirit—we have communed to-<br>gether,<br>Mine too such wild arrays, for reasons of their own;<br>Was't charged against my chants they had forgotten <br>art?<br>To fuse within themselves its rules precise and deli-<br>catesse?<br>The lyrist's measure'd beat, the wrought out temple's <br>grace—columns and plish'd arch forgot?<br>but thou that revelest here—spirit that form'd this<br>scene,<br>They have remember'd thee.</p><p>In four lines Mr. Whitman catches a thought that embalms philosophy in poetry. It is this:</p><p><em>ROAMING IN THOUGHT.</em></p><p>[After reading Hegel.]<br>Roaming in thought over the Universe, I saw the <br>little that is good steadily hastening towards <br>immortality,<br>And the vast all that is call'd Evil I saw hastening <br>to merge itself and become lost and dead.</p><p>Two other poems of exceptional merit and both new, we quote: The first is:</p><p><em>THE DALLIANCE OF THE EAGLES.</em></p><p>Skirting the river road, (my forenoon walk, my <br>rest,)<br>Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound, the dalliance <br>of the eagles,<br>The rushing amorous contact high in space together,<br>The clinching interlocking claws, a living, fierce, <br>gyrating wheel,<br>Four beating wings, two beaks, a swirling mass <br>tight grappling,<br>In tumbling turning clustering loops, straight down-<br>ward falling,<br>Till o'er the river pois'd, the twain yet one, a mo-<br>ment's lull,<br>A motionless still balance in the air, then parting, <br>talons loosening,<br>Upward again on slow-firm pinions slanting, their <br>separate diverse flight,<br>She hers, he his, pursuing.</p><p>The second like the one previously quoted is inspired by bird life, and its force is apparent:</p><p><em>TO THE MAN-OF-WAR BIRD.</em></p><p>Thou who hast slept all night upon the storm,<br>Waking renew'd on thy prodigious pinions.<br>(Burst the wild storm? above it thou ascended'st,<br>And rested on the sky, thy slave that cradled thee),<br>Now a blue point, far, far in heaven floating.<br>As to the light emerging here on deck I watch thee,<br>(Myself a speck, a point on the world's floating <br>vast)</p><p>Far, far at sea,<br>After the night's fierce drifts have strewn the shore <br>with wrecks,<br>With reappearing day as now so happy and serene,<br>The rosy and elastic dawn, the flashing sun,<br>The limpid spread of air cerulean,<br>Thou also reappearest.<br>Thou born to match the gale (thou art all wings)<br>To cope with heaven and earth and sea and hurri-<br>cane,<br>Thou ship of air that never furl's thy sails,<br>Days, even weeks untired and onward, through <br>spaces, realms gyrating.<br>At dusk that look'st on Senegal, at morn America,<br>That sport'st amid the lightning flash and thunder <br>cloud,<br>In them, in thy experiences, had'st thou my soul,<br>What joys! what joys were thine!</p><p>Mr. Whitman still braves the criticism adverse to certain passages of his poems which has been made. He has expunged none of the lines, except to gain conciseness. That the public is gradually coming to appreciate Walt Whitman and recognize his worth as a poet is evident, and the new edition of his works will be gladly welcomed.</p><p>Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass.'</p><p>PRACTICALLY, but not actually, this is the first time that Mr. Whitman has issued his poems through a publishing house instead of at his private cost. The two volumes called Leaves of Grass and the Two Rivulets, which he had printed and himself sold at Camden, N. J., are now issued in one, under the former title, without special accretions of new work, but not without a good deal of re-arrangement in the sequence of the poems. Pieces that were evidently written later, and intended to be eventually put under Leaves of Grass now find their place; some that apparently did well enough where they were have been shifted to other departments. On the whole, however, the changes have been in the direction of greater clearness as regards their relation to the sub-titles. It is not apparent, however, that the new book is greatly superior to the old in typography, although undeniably the fault of the privately printed volumes, a variation in types used, is no longer met with. The margins are narrower, and the look of the page more commonplace. The famous poem called 'Walt Whitman' is now the 'Song of Myself.' It still maintains:</p><p>I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable;<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p><p>It still has the portrait of Whitman when younger, standing in a loose flannel shirt and slouched hat, with one hand on his hip, the other in his pocket. 'Eidolons' has been taken from the second volume and placed, for good reasons that the reader may not be ready to understand, among the first pieces gathered under the sub-title 'Inscriptions.' It ends with the 'Songs of Parting,' under which the last is 'So Long,' a title that a foreigner and perhaps many an American might easily consider quite as untranslatable as Mr. Whitman proclaims himself to be. The motive for the publication seems to be to take advantage of that wider popularity which is coming somewhat late in life to him whom his admirers like to call 'the good gray poet.'</p><p>One great anomaly of Whitman's case has been that while he is an aggressive champion of democracy and of the working-man, in a broad sense of the term working-man, his admirers have been almost exclusively of a class the farthest possibly removed from that which labors for daily bread by manual work. Whitman has always been truly caviare to the multitude. It was only those that knew much of poetry and loved it greatly who penetrated the singular shell of his verses and rejoiced in the rich, pulpy kernel. Even with connoisseurs, Whitman has been somewhat of an acquired taste, and it has always been amusing to note the readiness with which persons who would not or could not read him, raised a cry of affectation against those who did. This phenomenon is too well known in other departments of taste to need further remark; but it may be added that Mr. Whitman has both gained by it and lost. He has gained a vigorousness of support on the part of his admirers that probably more than outbalances the acrid attacks of those who consider his work synonymous with all that is vicious in poetical technique, and wicked from the point of morals. As to the latter, it must be confessed that, according to present standards of social relations, the doctrines taught by Whitman might readily be construed, by the overhasty or unscrupulous, into excuses for foul living: for such persons do not look below the surface, nor can they grasp the whole idea of Whitman's treatment of love. However fervid his expressions may be, and however scornful he is of the miserable hypocrisies that fetter but also protect the evilly disposed, it is plain that the idea he has at heart is that universal love which leaves no room for wickedness because it leaves no room for doing or saying unkind, uncharitable, unjust things to his fellow-man. With an exuberance of thought that would supply the mental outfit of ten ordinary poets, and with a rush of words that is by no means reckless, but intensely and grandly labored, Whitman hurls his view of the world at the heads of his readers with a vigor and boldness that takes away one's breath.</p><p>This century is getting noted among centuries for singular departures in art and literature. Among them all, there is none bolder or more original than that of Whitman. Perhaps Poe in his own line might be cited as an equal. It is strange, and yet it is not strange, that he should have waited so long for recognition, and that by many thousands of people of no little culture his claims to being a poet at all are either frankly scouted or else held in abeyance. Literature here has remarkably held aloof from the vital thoughts and hopes of the country. It seems as if the very crudity of the struggle here drove people into a petty dilettante atmosphere of prettiness in art and literature as an escape from the dust and cinders of daily life. Hence our national love for 'slicked up' pictures, for instance, by which it is often claimed in Europe that promising geniuses in painting, there, have been ruined for higher work. Hence our patronage of poets that have all the polish of a cymbal, but all a cymbal's dry note and hollowness. Hence, at one time, our admiration for orators that were ornate to the verge of inanity. Into this hot-house air of literature Walt Whitman bounded, with the vigor and suppleness of a clown at a funeral. Dire were the grimaces of the mourners in high places, and dire are their grimaces still.</p><p>There were plenty of criticisms to make, even after one had finished crying Oh! at the frank sensuality, the unbelievable nakedness of Walt. Everything that decent folk covered up, Walt exhibited, and boasted of exhibiting! He was proud of his nakedness and sensuality. He cried, Look here, you pampered rogues of literature, what are you squirming about, when you know, and everybody knows, that things are just like this, always have been, always will be? But it must be remembered that this was what he wrote, and that he did with a plan, and by order from his genius. It has never been heard of him that he was disgusting in talk or vile in private life, while it has been known that poets celebrated for the lofty tone of their morality, for the strictness of their Christianity, the purity of their cabinet hymns, can condescend in private life to wallow in all that is base. That is the other great anomaly of Whitman. He rhapsodizes of things seldom seen in print with the enthusiasm of a surgeon enamoured of the wonderful mechanism of the body. But he does not soil his conversation with lewdness. If evil is in him, it is in his book.</p><p>Whitman's strength and Whitman's weakness lie in his lack of taste. As a mere external sign, look at his privately printed volumes. For a printer and typesetter, reporter and editor, they do not show taste in the selection and arrangement of the type. A cardinal sin in the eyes of most critics is the use of French, Spanish, and American-Spanish words which are scattered here and there, as if Whitman had picked them up, sometimes slightly incorrectly, from wandering minstrels, Cubans, or fugitives from one of Walker's raids. He shows crudely the American way of incorporating into the language a handy or a high-sounding word without elaborate examination of its original meaning, just as we absorb the different nationalities that crowd over from Europe. His thought and his mode of expression is immense, often flat, very often monotonous, like our great sprawling cities with their endless scattering of suburbs. Yet when one gets the 'hang' of it, there is a colossal grandeur in conception and execution that must finally convince whoever will be patient enough to look for it. His rhythm, so much burlesqued, is all of a part with the man and his ideas. It is apparently confused; really most carefully schemed; certainly to a high degree original. It has what to the present writer is the finest thing in the music of Wagner - a great booming movement or undertone, like the noise of heavy surf. His crowded adjectives are like the medival writers of Irish, those extraordinary poets who sang the old Irish heroes and their own contemporaries, the chiefs of their clans. No Irishman of to-day has written a nobler lament for Ireland, or a more hopeful, or a more truthful, than has Walt Whitman. Yet it is not said that he has Irish blood. Nor is there to be found in our literature another original piece of prose so valuable to future historians as his notes on the war. Nor is there a poet of the war-time extant who has so struck the note of that day of conflict as Whitman has in 'Drum Taps.' He makes the flesh creep. His verses are like the march of the long lines of volunteers, and then again like the bugles of distant cavalry. But these are parts of him. As he stands complete in Leaves of Grass, in spite of all the things that regard for the decencies of drawing-rooms and families may wish away, he certainly represents, as no other writer in the world, the struggling, blundering, sound-hearted, somewhat coarse, but still magnificent vanguard of Western civilization that is encamped in the United States of America. He avoids the cultured few. He wants to represent, and does in his own strange way represent, the lower middle stratum of humanity. But, so far, it is not evident that his chosen constituency cares for, or has even recognized him. Wide readers are beginning to guess his proportions.</p><p>———</p><p>Leaves of Grass By Walt Whitman. Boston: James R. Osgood & Co.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN'S WORKS.</p><p>James R. Osgood & Co. have published a new and enlarged edition of Walt Whitman's poems. It contains all the old ones and many new, including 383 in all, and is embellished with two portraits of the author. The following are selections from the volume:</p><p><em>TEARS.</em></p><p>Tears! tears! tears!<br>In the night, in solitude, tears,<br>On the white shore dripping, dripping, suck'd in by the <br>sand,<br>Tears, not a star shining, all dark and desolate,<br>Moist tears from the eyes of a muffled head;<br>O who is that ghost? that form in the dark, with tears?<br>What shapeless hump is that, bent, crouch'd there on the <br>sand?<br>Screaming tears, sobbing tears, throes choked with wild <br>cries;<br>O storm, embodied, rising, careering with swift steps <br>along the beach!<br>O wild and dismal night storm, with wind—O belching <br>and desperate!<br>O shade so sedate and decorous by day, with calm counte-<br>nance and regulated pace.<br>But away at night as you fly, none looking—O then the <br>unloosen'd ocean<br>Of tears! tears! tears!</p><p><em>ITALIAN MUSIC IN DAKOTA.</em></p><p>'The Seventeenth—the finest Regimental Band I ever heard.'<br>Through the soft evening air enwinding all,<br>Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries endless wilds,<br>In dulcet streams, in flutes' and cornets' notes,<br>Electric, pensive, turbulent, artificial,<br>(Yet strangely fitting even here, meaning unknown be-<br>fore,<br>Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here, related <br>here,<br>Not to the city's fresco'd rooms, not to the audience of the <br>opera house,<br>Sounds, echoes, wandering strains, as really bare at home,<br>Sonnambula's innocent love, trios with Norma's anguish,<br>And thy ecstatic chorus Poliuto;)<br>Ray'd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,<br>Music, Italian music in Dakota.</p><p>While Nature, sovereign of this gnarl'd realm,<br>Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses,<br>Acknowledging rapport however far remov'd,<br>(As some old root of soil its best-born flower or <br>fruit)<br>Listens well pleas'd.</p><p><em>WITH ALL THY GIFTS.</em></p><p>With all thy gifts America,<br>Standing secure, rapidly tending, overlooking the world,<br>Power, wealth, extent, vouchsafed to thee—with these and <br>like of these vouchsafed to thee<br>What if one gift thou lackest (the ultimate human <br>problem never solving,)<br>The gift of perfect women fit for thee—what if that gift <br>of gifts thou lackest?<br>The towering feminine of thee? the beauty, health, com-<br>pletion fit for thee?<br>The mother's fit for thee?</p><p><em>WHAT BEST I SEE IN THEE.</em></p><p>To U.S.G. return'd from his World's Tour.<br>What best I see in thee,<br>Is not that where thou mov'st down history's great highways,<br>Ever undimm'd by time shoots warlike victory's dazzle,<br>Or that thou sat'st where Washington sat, ruling the land in peace,<br>Or thou the man whom feudal Europe feted, venerable Asia <br>swarm'd upon,<br>Who walk'd with kings with even pace the round world's prome-<br>nade;<br>But that in foreign lands, in all thy walks with kings,<br>Those prairie sovereigns of the West, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois,<br>Ohio's, Indiana's millions, comrades, farmers, soldiers, all to the <br>front,<br>Invisibly with thee walking with kings with even pace the round <br>world's promenade,<br>Were all so justified.</p><p>Walt Whitman's New Book.</p><p>From Our Special Correspondent.</p><p>BOSTON, Tuesday, November 8.</p><p>. . .</p><p>It was a great age, men will say hereafter, and a grand country that could produce in one generation three figures for posterity to gaze on like John Brown, Abraham Lincoln and Walt Whitman,—men unlike each other and unlike all others, such as no other land produced or could produce; embodied heroism, embodied sense and sensibility, embodied imagination. So I view the three men, in the mass of their character,—not considering the loose and trivial details which to many eyes have seemed to be the whole character. It if were possible to see the genius of a great people throwing itself now into this form, now into that,—as the prairie wheat-field takes the quick shape of the passing wind-it would be just to say that we had seen this mystery in the 'plain heroic magnitude of mind' with which [John] Brown met death,—in the broad and patient wisdom of Lincoln,—and in the immense landscape of Whitman's teeming and unharvested imagination. His 'Leaves of Grass,' as he has now published them at Osgood's in Boston, complete the vast picture of his mind and bring out not merely the confusion of details, which we could only see at first, by the light of poetic flashes—but the broad unity of the piece. It is as if the ancient seamen had found their ocean-god slumbering along his shores, and upon near view could only see a hand here, an eyebrow there, a floating mass of beard elsewhere,—but when they stood back from the strand, or best if they climbed a hill of prospect, the symmetry and articulation of the mighty frame plainly appeared, and they knew by sight their unconscious divinity, Neptune. There is in Whitman's verse, more than in any other modern poet's, what Keats called 'that large utterance of the early gods,'-an indistinct grandeur of expression not yet molded to the melody of Shakespeare, Lucretius and Æschylus, but like what Keats again calls 'the overwhelming voice of huge Enceladus':—</p><p>'Whose ponderous syllables, like sullen waves<br>In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rock<br>Came booming thus,'—</p><p>'I announce natural persons to arise,<br>I announce justice triumphant,<br>I announce uncompromising liberty and equality,<br>I announce the justification of candor and the justifi- <br>cation of pride.<br>I announce that the identity of those states is a sin-<br> gle identity only,<br>I announce the Union more and more compact, indis-<br> soluble,<br>I announce splendors and majesties to make all the <br>previous polities of the earth insignificant.'</p><p>It is when he speaks of Lincoln and the civil war that Whitman is least indistinct, and no other of our poets-no nor all of them together-has so well caught and rendered the spirit of that struggle as he has done it. As has been remarked by others no doubt, and more than once, Whitman gives the whole episode of slavery in its relation to the war, in the strange fragment called</p><p><em>ETHIOPIA SALUTING THE COLORS.</em></p><p>Who are you, dusky woman, so ancient, hardly human,With your woolly-white and turbaned head, and bare bony feet?Why, rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?</p><p>'Tis while our army lines Carolina's sands and pines,<br>Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia com'st to <br>me,<br>As under doughty Sherman I march toward the sea.</p><p><em>Me, master, years a hundred since from my parents <br>sundered.<br>A little child they caught me as the savage beast <br>is caught,<br>Then hither me across the sea, the cruel slaver <br>brought.</em></p><p>No further does she say, but lingering all day,<br>Her high borne turbaned head she wags, and rolls <br>her darkling eye,<br>And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving <br>by.</p><p>What is it, fateful woman, so blear, hardly human?<br>Why wag your head with turban bound, yellow, red <br>and green?<br>Are the things so strange and marvelous you see or <br>have seen?</p><p>This new volume of Whitman's contains philosophy, antiquities and history all in one, and is the book of the year in Boston which will bear the most reading and study. The only one to compare with it is another of Osgood's publications, Mr Cooke's 'Ralph Waldo Emerson,'-and the two are curiously related to each other. But for Emerson, Whitman might never have written, or written in another form, and what can be further from the Emersonian mode of writing than these unformed and almost lawless numbers, this broad range over the most prosaic elements of life, as well as those regions of ideal beauty in which the genius of Emerson delights?</p><p>Walt Whitman's New Book.</p><p>A good many folks in middle Long Island, especially Huntington, West Hills (where Walt Whitman was born), Cold Spring and down at Babylon, where he lived as boy and young man, will no doubt take special interest in the fact that the new book of his completed poems, 'Leaves of Grass' has just been published by James R. Osgood & Co. of Boston, in a handsome 382 page volume, price $2. There are about three hundred pieces all composed in the free and capricious measure so peculiar to Whitman (entirely unlike poetry as generally written), and which few people will like at first sight, whatever they may do after studying it well out.</p><p>Mr. Whitman was here in Huntington last summer and it is said intends coming again next season. He is crippled from paralysis, is now in his 63d year; he still writes, lectures, gives readings from his works and travels moderately. The Boston Herald says of his poems: </p><p>'One of the great features of Walt Whitman is that he does not seek his ideals in faraway times, which, stripped of their glamor of remoteness, are but as the times of to-day; for in supreme moments, he idealizes the common-place, and has the clearness of vision that discerns the gleam of gold through all the accumulated dross.</p><p>The large and magnificent tolerance that includes all and allows all, and finds a place for all, is a sublime characteristic of the man. There is much in these lines that cannot be packed into layers of equal length. The book teems with the ecstacy of being. The statement of details into which the poet now and then drops has been criticised as 'cataloguing.' But viewed with the poet’s intention, what a mosaic picture of the people, of the nation and its races, is thus constituted! One sees the stir and hears the hum of the entire land; feels the pulse of the multitude. What is the use of attempting to depict such a thing—it can't all be shown. But the effect is like a gleam of sunshine in the depths of a forest; it reveals many things with vivid distinctness; there is a vast reserve of hidden things which might be seen, but enough is shown to tell what is there—to give the character of the place.</p><p>The new edition contains all his poems; the only changes that have been made are in the way of condensation of utterance. There are, also, something like 20 new poems printed direct from the manuscript. There is more of a rounding and completeness of the work; the all-embracing patriotism which forms one of the poet’s grandest characteristic is more comprehensive than ever before manifested.'</p><p><em>FROM WALT WHITMAN'S NEW BOOK. </em><br><p><em>PATROLING BARNEGAT.</em></p><p>Wild, wild the storm, and the sea high running,<br>Steady the roar of the gale, with incessant under-tone muttering,<br>Shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing,<br>Waves, air, midnight, their savagest trinity lashing,<br>Out in the shadows there, milk-white combs careering,<br>On beachy slush and sand, spirts of snow fierce slanting,<br>Where, through the murk, the easterly death-wind breasting,<br>Through cutting swirl and spray, watchful and firm advancing,<br>(That in the distance! is that a wreck? is the red signal flaring?)<br>Slush and sand of the beach, tireless till daylight wending,<br>Steadily, slowly, through hoarse roar never remitting,<br>Along the midnight edge, by those milk-white combs careering,<br>A group of dim, weird forms, struggling, the night confronting,<br>That savage trinity warily watching.</p><p>'LEAVES OF GRASS.' </p><p>———</p><p>Kosmos, or Walt Whitman's Song of the Universe. </p><p>———</p><p>A Perfect Poem-Picture of American Democracy. </p><p>———</p><p>The Hermit Thoreau's Opinion of Our Good Gray Poet. </p><p>———</p><p>Should any one ask the question, 'Will Walt Whitman, the poet, and 'Leaves of Grass' (the work on which his fame will rest, whatever he may write in the future), now that after upward of twenty-five years of patient waiting both have got within the sacred circle controlled by a syndicate of literary men and publishers, become rapidly popular?' The answer must be, 'No.' The book is too radical, too free, too independent and far too true to make its conquest of a popular verdict an easy matter. To the question, 'Will the book and the man ever be popular?' the answer, in the opinion of the present writer, must be a qualified 'Yes.' Walt Whitman is, par excellence, the poet and priest of democracy—the American type of democracy; the democracy based upon individuality, though not, perhaps, the ultimate democracy; the democracy based upon I, the individual; not the democracy based upon we, the sum of all individuals. In 'Leaves of Grass' Walt Whitman has personified—or rather, idealized—the genius of American democracy. The work cannot be separated into any number of complete and independent poems: it is one complete and all-embracing poem, the subject of which is the Kosmos. It is the Kosmos as viewed from the standpoint of the American idea of democracy—the sovereignty of each and every individual. Walt Whitman is an individualist of the most pronounced type. So, while admitting that his grand psalms of the Universe will attain a gradual and limited popularity, attaining such popularity only as fast as they become popularly understood, their influence may diminish should ever the American idea of democracy—individual sovereignty—lose its hold on popular opinion.</p><p>Walt Whitman has written the drama—it may be almost called the history—of the first century of American civilization. It may be doubted whether it will fit the second century as well; indeed, how could that be expected, for is it possible to write</p><p><strong>The Drama of the Future!</strong></p><p>All that we can know of the future we have learned from the past and from what we can understand of the tendencies of this present time; but what poet or seer, let him be ever so wise, can forecast the future development—even for one brief century—of the wonderful, creative, multitudinous human mind? But let us take a survey of the book. Let us see how far it fits the foregoing remarks. First, as to the title—why 'Leaves of Grass?' The author himself evidently loves the title, as is evinced by the ornamentation not only of the latest but of previous editions. His very signature on the cover reminds one of grass—and it has a meaning. Let us read the opening in his own words:</p><p>'A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with <br>full hands;<br>How could I answer the child? I do not know what it <br>is any more than he.<br>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of <br>hopeful green-stuff woven.<br>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord.<br>A scented gift and rememberance designedly dropt.<br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, <br>that we may see and remark, and say whose?</p><p>Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced <br>babe of the vegetation.</p><p>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>And it means, sprouting alike is broad zones and <br>narrow zones.<br>Growing among black folks as among white,<br>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I gave them <br>the same, I receive the same.</p><p>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of <br>graves.<br>. . . . . . . . <br>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death.<br>And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not <br>wait at the end to arrest it,<br>And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.</p><p>All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,<br>And to die is different from what any one supposed, <br>and luckier.'</p><p>'Leaves of Grass,' then, are not only symbolical of all the great alchemy of nature, of all creation, all production, all evolution, but symbolical of immortality as well—the permanence and indestructability of all things. And so the title is good.</p><p>What of the man? What of Walt Whitman himself? This brings us to one of the most interesting features of the book; indeed, the key to its entire plan-its marked personality. It was not by mere whim or caprice—much less by accident or any publisher's device—that the unique portrait of the author (the only illustration of the volume) is not in the usual place, fronting the title-page, but incorporated in the verse, and accompanied by his account of his own relation to his work and to the reader. This is introduced as a</p><p><strong>Song of Myself.</strong></p><p>and is carried through fifty-two stanzas, occupying fifty pages. The portrait, copied from a daguerreotype taken in 1856, when he was a working carpenter, as well as an unhatched poet—represents him in the loose shirt, open at the neck and lapping over the waist of the unbraced pants of an ordinary mechanic; his flannel undershirt revealed; a broad-brimmed, soft felt hat carelessly thrown back sideways on his head, which is inclined in the same way. The expression on his face shows energy, self-reliance and is full of thought; his attitude is firm, careless and unstudied-the left hand in his pocket and the right resting with bent elbows on his hip, which is thrown up to support it.

quoted serve to give some idea of the spirit and meaning of this wonderful poem of humanity and the universe? It has been written with the hope that it may, but with no expectation of doing anything like justice to the vast range of observation, profundity and minuteness of analysis, philosophic and religious interpretation, intimate knowledge and deep and earnest sympathy, not only with all humanity but with all nature, that</p><p><strong>Place this Book in the Front Rank</strong></p><p>of the highest branches of American literature. One might as well try to epitomize Shakespeare in a newspaper article as to try to do so with 'Leaves of Grass.' That all who read this imperfect review will be induced thereby to read and study the volume for themselves, and become greater, nobler and happier by the experience, is the earnest hope of the writer.</p><p>The following appreciative opinion of, that other faithful student of nature—Thoreau—written in 1856, and therefore at a time when even a man of his independence could hardly be expected to be very outspoken in the face of social prudery, will be read with interest, and will be a fitting appendix to what has been already said:</p><p>'He (Whitman) is apparently the greatest democrat the world has seen; a remarkably strong, though coarse nature, of a sweet disposition, and much prized by his friends. Though peculiar and rough in his exterior, his skin, all over, red, he is essentially a gentleman. I am still in some quandary about him—feel that he is essentially strange to me, at any rate; but am surprised by the sight of him. He is very broad, but not fine . . . . He has long been an editor and writer for the newspapers—was editor for the N.O. Crescent once . . . . Since I have seen him, I am not disturbed by any brag or egoism in his book. He is a great fellow. There are two or three pieces in the book which are disagreeable, at least, simply sensual. He does not celebrate love at all. It is as if the beasts spoke. I think men have not been ashamed of themselves without reason. No doubt there have always been dens where such deeds were unblushingly recited, and it is no merit to compete with such. But even on this side he has spoken more truth than any modern I know. [What of Shakespeare, Byron and Burns?] I have found his poem exhilarating, encouraging. [Emerson uses a similar expression.] As for its sensuality—and it may be less so than it seems—I do not so much wish those parts unwritten, as that men were so pure that they could read them without harm, that is without understanding them (?) . . . . On the whole it is to me very brave and American. We ought to rejoice greatly in him. He occasionally suggests something a little more than human. How people must shudder as they read him? He is awfully good. To be sure I sometimes feel a little imposed on. By his heartiness and broad generalities he puts me into a liberal frame of mind prepared to see wonders—as it were sets me upon a hill or in the midst of a plain—stirs me well up and then—throws in a thousand of brick. Though rude and sometimes ineffectual, it is a good primitive poem—an alarum or trumpet-note ringing through the American camp. Wonderfully like the Orientals, too, considering that when I asked if he had read them he answered, 'No; tell me about them.''</p><p>Thoreau has evidently written just what he felt when the surprise and what may be called the shock of an unprecedented revelation was fresh upon him. His candor and his good judgment, under the circumstances, is worthy of all commendation, but he might write differently today were he alive.</p><p>Walt Whitman, a Kosmos. </p><p>To make a mark on the sands of life in this busiest, windiest and most tidal period of the world's history, and to keep that mark fresh and deepening for seven-and-twenty years, is no little achievement for an American author. This Whitman has done, and something more than this. When in 1855 he printed with his own hands his odd and sprawling lines of his 'Leaves of Grass' (a few copies, long since out of print, though hardly any one bought them), he announced himself to the world as a poet, and he has never since taken down his sign. He still carries on business at the own stand; still 'sounds his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.' But now instead of six readers he has six thousand, or perhaps six hundred thousand and the back countries have not all been heard from yet. That they understand him we would not guarantee—he does not understand himself always; still less did he understand himself when he began to write. He put to sea on a raft and his only compass was a looking-glass, but he has made as good a voyage on the whole as if he had sailed in the Great Eastern with all the compasses and chronometers and astronomers on board.</p><p>'Were it the will of heaven an osier bough<br>Were vessel strong enough the seas to plow.'</p><p>So said Pindar, only more shortly,—and Whitman has verified the oracle. Courage and trust are the best outfit for a poet, it seems; they are worth all the colleges and libraries in the world. The world itself is the poet's library, and Whitman has had a card to that collection; he has even attempted a catalogue; but like all library catalogues it grows beyond his power to list and index. </p><p>There is a lawless saying, fit only for the wise, but full of meaning for poets and great captains,—</p><p>'Oft have I heard, and deem the witness true,<br>Whom man delights in, God delights in too.'</p><p>But the career of pleasure and admiration which is only possible to power soon finds its limits in human experience, and must be corrected by the sharp lessons of sorrow and mortification,—must be continued, if at all, by the completest self-renunciation and trust in the unseen powers. This discipline Whitman has had, it would seem, and has profited by it. His later poems are not quite in the key of his earlier; they have a more serious and religious tone; and their light is thrown back on the dangerous utterances of his youth. He has not rejected these utterances,—has indeed preserved most of them in this new volume,-but has softened them, changed their connection and brought them into a better accord with a life of service to mankind, such as the poet's must be if he would live beyond his own age. Consequently this book will be received, we fancy, as none of Whitman's former books have been. It will no longer be a work prohibited, but, in spite of many passages which must always keep it from a familiar place on the table, and from the perfect liberty of unformed judgments,—it will find its way into all good libraries and into many homes. For the civil war made Whitman a domestic poet, which he had hardly been before. The clear recognition and pathetic portrayal of the home affection in the Americans, not less than their patriotism and devotion to democracy, gives 'Drum Taps' an affectionate place in the hearts of his readers. The philosophy of 'Leaves of Grass' was oriental,—grand, but peculiar, and to the multitude either irreligious or suspicious,—but this was changed in the war-poems into a spirit which the multitude could understand, because they shared it,—which, indeed, was born of the multitude and possessed Whitman as one of the many, not as among the few. Another change noticeable in him at that time and since affected his meter and the melody of his verse. The measure of the old chapters in 'Leaves of Grass' can hardly be called a meter at all: what rhythm it had was rather like the rhythm of Hebrew poetry, in the antithesis or repetition of ideas, not in the harmonious arrangement of words. But it would seem as if the music of the regiments:—</p><p>'Sonorous metal blowing martial sound,'</p><p>had suggested to Whitman a new movement for his lines.3 They soon became measured and choral in their character,—not a set measure, like the tweedle-de-dum, tweedle-de-dee of the mediocre poets, but a dithyrambic orchestral movement, responding to chords struck at irregular intervals, and leaving the mind free to catch up the next strain, wherever it might come in. This in part is the secret of the Greek chorus-poetry, to which (though the Greek measures are more balanced and mutually responsive) the war pieces of Whitman, and much of his later poetry, bears a strong resemblance. The book deserves study even as a metrical anomaly, were it not entitled to consideration upon much higher regards.</p><p>Lofty as any sound estimate of Whitman's book must be, it has faults enough to have long ago destroyed the reputation of any writer who had not something better than singularity to commend him. Concerning these, as well as for a larger consideration of his work and place, we shall take another time to speak. Here we say only that the book is a noble one, and must be so adjudged before any proper discount upon its merits can be made.</p><p>New Publications</p><p>———</p><p>WALT WHITMAN.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS. 12mos. pp. 382. James H. Osgood & Co. </p><p>After the dilettante indelicacies of William H. Malleck and Oscar Wilde, we are presented with the slop-bucket of Walt Whitman. The celebrity of this phenomenal poet bears a curious disproportion to the circulation of his writings. Until now, it cannot be said that his verses have ever been published at all. They have been printed irregularly and read behind the door. They have been vaunted extravagantly by a band of extravagant disciples; and the possessors of the books have kept them locked up from the family. Some have valued them for the 'barbaric yawp,' which seems to them the note of a new, vigorous, democratic, American school of literature; some for the fragments of real poetry floating in the turbid mass; some for the nastiness and animal insensibility to shame which entitle a great many of the poems to a dubious reputation as curiosities. Now that they are thrust into our faces at the book stalls there must be a reexamination of the myth of the Good Gray Poet. It seems to me that there is no need at this late day to consider Mr. Whitman's claims to the immortality of genius. That he is a poet most of us frankly admit. His merits have been set forth many times, and at great length, and if the world has erred materially in its judgment of them the error has been a lazy and unquestioning acquiescence in some of the extreme demands of his vociferous partisans. The chief question raised by this publication is whether anybody—even a poet—ought to take off his trousers in the market place. Of late years we believe that Mr. Whitman has not chosen to be so shocking as he was when he had his notoriety to make, and many of his admirers—the rational ones—hoped that the 'Leaves of Grass' would be weeded out before he set them out again. But this has not been done; and indeed Mr. Whitman could hardly do it without falsifying the first principle of his philosophy, which is a belief in his own perfection, and the second principle, which is a belief in the preciousness of filth. 'Divine am I,' he cries. 'Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched from. The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer. This head more than churches, Bibles and all the creeds.' He knows that he is 'august.' He does not care for anybody's opinion. He is </p><p>Walt Whitman, a kosmos of Manhattan the son,<br>Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding.<br>No sentimentalist, no slander above men and women or apart from them.<br>No more modest than immodest.</p><p>There is nothing in the universe better than Walt Whitman. That is the burden of the 'Song of Myself' which fills fifty pages of the present volume: </p><p>I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious.</p><p>Nothing is obscene or indecent to him. It is his mission to shout the forbidden voices, to tear the veil off everything, to clarify and transfigure all that is dirty and vile, to proclaim that garbage is just as good as nectar if you are only lusty enough to think so. His immodesty is free from glamour of every sort. Neither amatory sentiment nor susceptibility to physical beauty appears to have anything to do with it. It is entirely bestial; and in this respect we know of nothing in literature which can be compared with it. Walt Whitman, despising what he calls conventionalism, and vaunting the athletic democracy, asks to be accepted as the master of a new poetical school, fresh, free, stalwart, 'immense in passion, pulse and power,' the embodiment of the spirit of vigorous America. But the gross materialism of his verses represents art in its last degradation rather than its rude infancy.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN'S POEMS.</p><p>THIS is the collected and revised poetry of Walt Whitman, who, some will have it, is by preeminence of art and nature our representative American poet. It will be noticed that at last he has found a publisher other than himself. What this nation may become it might not be wise to prophesy; but we may at the start humbly entertain the hope, at least, that at this present writing our nationality, in root and fiber, is something else than what Mr. Whitman sings. His book is one of courage, most downright in its dogmatics, and says its say apparently without the slightest consideration for the fact that much it says must cross and shock the deepest ethical instincts of a great multitude—we should certainly hope the vast majority of those American men and women who by any misfortune are led to read him. For these poems are of that breed that they force the honest critic into a corner where he must either speak plain words, or step down and out from his judgment-seat. This is a book which makes not only war upon nearly all traditional theories of true poetry, but in many places a very brutal assault upon our fixed ideas of human decency and purity. For instance, it has long been held that poetry is not merely the prose of any philosophy, history, geography, anthropology, or, we might add, anatomy or sexual physiology; but must have some sort of inherent rhythm and melody—the heartbeats and spiritual pulsations of the poet. This, for want of a better term, we call the form of poetry. Tennyson, for example, is a master of poetic form. The poems under review, as to form, run to a chaos of monotonies. It is not the chaotic diversity of the wild woods, or the sea waves, or the autumn leaves, or the sand grains in a gravel-pit, in all which there is the articulated beauty and inbred virtue of nature obedient to the Great Craftsman. The chaos of Mr. Whitman's verse, to compare great with small, reminds us of the gray clay bluffs of Truro Beach. Would it were as clean! In form he reminds us of Martin Farquhar Tupper.</p><p>There is vastly more to be said as to his substance. First of all, and gladly, this: that he has, in his nigh four hundred pages, spurts and flashes of some things which say: 'This could and should have been a noble creature.' He has a quick, sharp sight for the surfaces of natural scenery, as when he speaks of the 'heart-shaped' leaf of the lilac; but somehow he seems incapable of grasping the inner spiritual lessons of field and flood, or a spiritual analogy. The best instance of the opposite we have found on a careful search is this:</p><p>I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of <br>the stars (p. 53).</p><p>His grasp of the detail of an event, but not of its ethical quality, is shown in his description of a sea-fight [pp. 62-63]. Somehow he never shows us the soul of anything. We may ask even, 'Does he believe there is any such thing as a soul?' American he is, of the ruder and more barbaric type, a prairie cow boy in a buffalo robe, with a voice of the east wind, shouting prophecies and incantations about what he thinks he sees and knows. But from civilized speech or melody he seems strangely remote. Egotism, if a virtue, is certainly an unfragrant one, and Walt Whitman's egotism, grotesque as it is, is perhaps less grotesque than gigantic. He describes himself well enough in the lines,</p><p>I am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable— <br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p> <p>Mr. Whitman's religion is no doubt to him a serious matter, and it is a somewhat serious matter to discover what in the world it is. He often discourses eloquently of God, as when (p. 76) he says:</p><p>I find letters from God dropt in the street and every one is <br>signed by God's name,<br>And I leave them where they are for I know that whereso-<br>ever I go<br>Others will punctually come forever and ever.</p><p>Yet the prevalent tone of his verses is curiously Asiatic, as though he were an incarnation of Brahma, and a pantheist. He says (p. 31):</p><p>Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that <br>is not my soul.</p><p>(A cess-pool, for instance).</p><p>In fact, he declares himself to be all that the universe is, even to being at the same moment each of two exactly opposite things, as though a man at any given instant were and were not. Indeed, it is this rapt but noisy mysticism which makes it rather hard to finger Mr. Whitman and touch his quality. Not that true poetry does not allow mysticism, or that mystics are not often poets. Indeed, high poetry is often a blessed hint, and only a hint, of a vaster world within the veil of the unreachable and the non- measurable.</p><p>Uhland's ballad, 'The Two Locks of Hair,' for instance, hints at the draped and veiled world of sorrow, whose mysteries are only revealed to the mourners after here. Mr. Whitman's mysticism is a fog-bank that cloaks all, even the possible hint itself. Add to this his all-pervading oracularity of speech, and he is certainly a man hard to be 'understanded' of common folk. And yet there are gleams in his book, not only of great things, but of possibly magnificent ones. His tribute to Abraham Lincoln (p. 262), beginning 'O Captain! my Captain!' is a weird and rare performance. 'The Singer in the Prison' (p. 292) beginning</p><p>O sight of pity, shame and dole <br>O fearful thought—a convict soul,</p><p>is full of tenderness and pathos.</p><p>The ethical quality of Mr. Whitman's poems remains to be examined. Here, in all honesty, it is hard to know what to say or what to leave unsaid. Gray hairs have their rights, and ought to be a shield against taunt and bitterness; but woman's purity and human society have their rights also, and there are little children growing up into the arena of the world's toil and trial who have their rights as well. We go now upon the assumption that there are certain elements of decency which pervade all human society, heathen and otherwise, and that the world is not too old to blush. We say that there are passages in this book that never ought to have been written, much less published; passages which sound like a lecture on the obstetrics of lust and (may we say it with all deference to our well-bred readers) the apotheosis of the Phallus. It is hard to overstate this matter. When a man with such physical imagery of shame sum- mons the very wind (p. 49) to be assistant in a poetical concubinage as realistic as a French invisible card, and the salt sea also (p. 46), it is certainly time for us common mortals who have still some respect for the seventh commandment to stay in doors from the elements, or, if at sea, to make all speed for the shore. The offense in this wise is not all-pervading, but it is very acute and deep.</p><p>His apologists will say of him that he is only another Adam in the Garden, naked and not ashamed. We say of him, and of all who have assisted in the making of his book, that they are guilty of an act of indecent exposure. For the rest, what Mr. Whitman might have been in poetry we have tried to fairly state. We can only add that if in these Leaves of Grass he has shown himself to be a poet, then the great and shining ones whom the English-speaking race have been wont to honor with this high title, are not.</p><p><em>Leaves of Grass James R. Osgood & Co. </em></p><p>Walt Whitman and the Poetry of the Future. </p><p>The publication of the Leaves of Grass by a reputable bookmaking house, as a business enterprise, and without expurgation, marks very distinctly an epoch in WALT WHITMAN's career. It was inevitable that the force of his genius should carry, sooner or later, the inner citadel of respectable literature; but the event has been delayed for a quarter of a century. During that time he has been his own printer and bookseller. Containing passages which under a strict construction of certain statutes of the United States could not be permitted to pass through the mails, the privately printed volumes have found a constantly increasing number of purchasers and readers. The accessions have not been from the ranks of the depraved and prurient. Walt Whitman's audience has grown, not by reason of, but in spite of, his frank disregard of some of the proprieties of utterance. Of this side of the matter it is enough to say that if the new edition is a triumph for the poet, it has been achieved without any concession on his part. He has modified nothing. He has cancelled no objectionable line or offensive phrase. He has confessed no sin against good taste or decency. In pushing his way into his present company he has not for an instant hauled in his elbows.</p><p>In another respect the appearance of the new edition of 'Leaves of Grass' is an interesting event. For the first time, the poet can be judged by his poetic scheme in its entirety. The additional verses are not so important in themselves as in the relation of parts to a completed whole. Walt Whitman's admirers have always insisted that criticism before the final development of the plan was premature. The poet has compared his work to one of those ambitious old architectural edifices, built part by part at long intervals, and showing the designer's idea only when the last stone was in place. The gaps have now all been filled. The revision of the several poems, and their rearrangement with reference to the sub-titles and to each other, leave them, we are told, as they were designed to be.</p><p>While Walt Whitman has kept steadily on his way, unshaken in belief in his mission and uncompromising as to his methods, he has provoked a difference of public opinion more marked, perhaps, than in the case of any author now alive. His aggressiveness seems to leave no middle ground. He is either a genius of colossal proportions or an immense windbag; either to be hailed and worshipped or to be punctured. A considerable part of his contemporaries hold him to be beneath criticism; a small circle of ardent admirers exalt him above it. The poet himself, it is to be feared, is prone to encourage the latter view. Every page that he has written discloses an egotism that reaches the verge of sublimity. He is impatient even of discriminating eulogy. He is said to hold as no better than a vender of scurrilities a friend of his, himself a poet, who not long ago published a magazine article in which the laudation of 'Leaves of Grass' was measured instead of being unreserved. With Walt it is: Take me or leave me; but if you take me, take me as the Consummate Man. In estimating a singer and seer this indomitable self-confidence is a quality that ought not to be overlooked. To refuse to admit it as corroborative proof of genius would be to reject one of the lessons of biography. Walt's vigorous personality and the purity and na‹ve simplicity of his private life have drawn about him a circle of devoted friends. They cannot understand why his genius should be denied or overlooked any more than they can see how the existence of the sun can be denied or overlooked when it is shining in a clear sky at noonday. They are exasperated because the great public is so slow to accept the poet at their valuation and his own. On the other hand, those to whom Whitman is a noisy madman, or a disturber of the poetic peace, or a bawler of platitudes, are reluctant to give the poet's adherents credit for any better motive than the affectation of eccentricity. The 'good gray poet' business disgusts them. They are puzzled by the admiration with which Whitman's achievements are regarded by Emerson and Tennyson and other bards who are as unlike the Bard of Paumanok as so many gentlemen in evening dress are unlike a gentleman in a diving suit. And all the while the belief is growing in cultivated minds that in Walt Whitman we have one of the most remarkable and original individualities in literature.</p><p>Let us look first at his method. It is from the superficial and non-essential characteristics of 'Leaves of Grass' that the popular conception of the poet is derived. The oddities, the whim-whams, the grotesque contrasts lie on the surface, lending themselves readily to burlesque, and affording plenty of material for ridicule.</p><p>Whitman's versification proceeds in the loosest possible fashion, discarding rhyme altogether, except in rare instances. A vague effect of rhythm is preserved, the cæsura recurring at irregular and often widely unequal intervals. It is an informal but roughly harmonious flow of words, sustaining the same relation to finished verse as the recitative to the aria. It is regarded by many as a startling innovation, but is really nothing more than a return to the earliest and most nearly spontaneous form of poetic expression. For purpose of comparison, as regards external form only, we place a passage from 'The Return of the Heroes' side by side with passages from the Sixty-fifth and One Hundred, and Fourth Psalms in the English version:</p><p>Loud O my throat, and clear O soul!<br>The season of thanks and the voice of full yielding,<br>The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.</p><p>All tilled and untilled lands expand before me,<br>I see the true arenas of my race, or first or last,<br>Man's innocent and strong arenas.</p><p>I see the heroes of other toils,<br>I see well wielded in their hands the better weapons.</p><p>I see where the Mother of All.<br>With full-spanning eye gazes forth, dwells long.<br>And counts the varied gathering of the products.</p><p>Busy the far, the sunlit panorama,<br>Prairie,orchard, and yellow grain of the North,<br>Cotton and rice of the South, and Louisiana cane,<br>Open unseeded follows, rich fields of clover and timothy,<br>Kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,<br>And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund <br>brook,<br>And healthy uplands with herby-perfumed breezes,<br>And the good, green grass, that delicate miracle the ever- <br>recurring grass.</p><p>———</p><p>Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion;<br>O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh<br>come.<br>Thou crownest the year with thy goodness.</p><p>Thy paths drop fatness, they drop upon the pastures of<br>the wilderness;<br>And the little hills rejoice on every side.</p><p>The pastures are clothed with flocks.<br>The valleys also are covered over with corn.</p><p>Bless the Lord,O my soul!<br>O Lord, my God, thou art very great;<br>Thou art clothed with honor and majesty.</p><p>He watereth the hills from his chambers;<br>The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.<br>He sendeth the springs into the valleys;<br>By them shall the fowls of the heavens have their hab- itationhabitation.<br>They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild<br>asses quench their thirst.<br>He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and the<br>herb for the service of man.</p><p>Again, we present the 'Address to the Sun,' of Ossian-Macpherson,1 in passages alternate with those of Walt Whitman's invocation of the same orb. In neither case is assistance given to the rhythm by artificial division of the verses. The interest of the comparison will be found to extend beyond the matter of form:</p><p><strong>OSSIAN.</strong></p><p>O thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers. Whence are thy beams, O Sun! thy everlasting light? Thou comest forth in thy awful beauty; the stars hide themselves in the sky; the moon, cold and pale, sinks in the western way; but thou thyself movest alone.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>Thou orb aloft full-dazzling, thou hot October noon! Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand, the sibilant near sea with vistas far, and foam, and tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue; O sun of noon refulgent! my special word to thee.</p><p><strong>OSSIAN.</strong></p><p>Who can be a companion of thy course! The oaks of the mountains fall; the mountains themselves decay with years: the ocean shrinks and grows again; the moon itself is lost in heaven; but thou art forever the same, rejoicing in the brightness of thy course.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>Hear me illustrious! Thy lover me, for always have I loved thee, even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some wood-edge, thy touching-distant beams enough, or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I launch my invocation.</p><p><strong>OSSIAN.</strong></p><p>When the world is dark with tempests, when thunder rolls and lightning flies, thou lookest in thy beauty from the clouds, and laughest at the storm. But to Ossian thou lookest in vain, for he beholds thy beams no more: whether thy yellow hair flows on the eastern clouds, or thou tremblest at the gates of the west.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>Thou that with fructifying heat and light, o'er myriad farms, o'er land and waters North and South, o'er Mississippi's endless course, o'er Texas' grassy plains, Kanada's woods, o'er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining inspace; thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents, seas: thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so liberally, shed, shed thyself on mine and me, with but a fleeting ray out of the million millions. Strike through these chants.</p><p><strong>OSSIAN.</strong></p><p>But thou art, perhaps, like me, for a season: thy years will have an end. Thou shalt sleep in thy clouds, careless of the voice of the morning. Exalt, then, O Sun, in the strength of thy youth! Age is dark and unlovely: it is like the glimmering light of the moon when it shines through broken clouds, and the mist is on the hills; the blast of the North is on the plain, the traveller shrinks in the midst of his journey.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these; prepare the later afternoon of me myself—prepare my lengthening shadows, prepare my starry nights.</p><p>This reversion to a primitive mode of poetic expression is particularly interesting, occurring as it does at a time when a certain school of English- speaking poets are paying so much heed to the merely mechanical and musical qualities of verse. Whitman wastes no strength in the elaboration of metres, of rhyme, of assonance, of refrain. He does not stop to think of melody. There is no doubt that his method is that of the least friction—the least amount of idea rubbed off in the process of conformation. Nor is there any doubt that it is the method best suited to his genius; it seems to be the natural language of his genius. His sturdy egotism, his sympathy with living Nature and with Man in action, are poured forth in a torrent of words unhampered by the laws of prosody. Fancy the untamable, untranslatable Walt pottering over rondeaux, or elaborating canzonets, or measuring off fourteen lines to the idea! In the three or four poems which have rhyme and the stanza, the rhymes are of the crudest and the stanzas are fetters:</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done.<br>The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought <br>is won;<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all <br>exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and <br>daring;<br>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>O,the bleeding drops of red,<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>A strange thing about Whitman's rugged recitative is that it never becomes monotonous. Within apparently narrow limits of possible variation, he manages to secure a wonderful variety. His longest cumulative passages, his catalogues of natural objects, catalogues of occupations, geographical and physiological lists, are something more than catalogues and lists. The art may be unconscious, but the result shows him a perfect master of the poetic accent. Walt Whitman would have made the catalogue of ships in the 'Iliad' a poem in itself. Where his voice sounds in the minor key the music is often so dainty that we fail to notice the absence of the conventional lyric forms. Some lines in 'Sea Drift' sound like a snatch of one of Shakespeare's songs:</p><p>Two together! <br>Winds blow south, or winds blow north, <br>Day come white, or white come black, <br>Home, or rivers and mountains from home, <br>Singing all time, minding no time, <br>While we two keep together. </p><p><em>Low hangs the moon, it rose late, It is lagging—O I think it is heavy with love, with love— </em></p><p>We have been speaking of some of the surface characteristics of Walt Whitman's poetry. If all poets were in the habit of using this recitative rhythm as a vehicle for their thoughts, what qualities would still distinguish him from the rest?</p><p>It seems to us that Walt Whitman is the truest representative of the reactionary movement against romanticism—the movement in which Emile Zola is a noisy and mercenary incidental. What he has undertaken to do is to exhibit with absolute unreserve the mind of a modern man in its relations to nature and to modern society. See me, says Walt, the average man of the nineteenth century, just as I am, with all the conventions and lies and shame stripped off, leaving my intellectual and emotional processes absolutely naked to view. See me as I am, bodily, too, if you care for the spectacle—every rag stripped off. And thus unclad, morally and physically, he proceeds to execute all the gymnastic antics that suggest themselves to the imagination of the child of nature when he is freed from the restraint of clothing and set out in the sunlight.</p><p>It is not from any lack of conscientious intention that the poet fails in part of his purpose, and instead of achieving a portrait of the real Walt gives us an approximate Walt, a partly real, partly ideal Walt. No man that ever lived has succeeded in making a complete exposure of himself. In the most intimate confidences there are still nooks and corners over which vanity does and always will insist on drawing the veil. Still, Whitman goes at his work lustily, and with many advantages. The individuality which he exhibits is interesting. His courage is dauntless. His sympathy with the external world is genuine; his heart beats in true accord with the heart of nature. He is a born poet, with imagination of a high order—the imagination which creates new material instead of moulding old stuff into new forms. As compared with Tennyson, for instance, who justly admires him, he is an architect who has conceived a plan and built an edifice, not merely an artist engaged in beautifying with exquisite skill the walls of a structure centuries old. Walt Whitman has found poetry in the so-called commonplace objects of Nineteenth century life. He views at night the 'far-sprinkled systems,' but he views them through a Nineteenth century scuttle, constructed by a carpenter of today. The scuttle is as poetic an orifice as the oriel or the mullioned window of the bartizan tower; but,being an essentially modern conception, it does not enjoy the prestige which they have in conventional verse. Whitman exults in showing side by side the sublime or the beautiful that has always been acknowledged as such, and the sublime or the beautiful unacknowledged and unrecognized by everybody but himself. He goes forth at night and sings:</p><p>I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,<br>I call to the earth and sea half-held by night.<br>Press close, bare-bosomed night; press close magnetic, <br>nourishing night!<br>Night of south winds—night of the large few stars!<br>Still nodding night—mad naked summer night!</p><p>Smile O voluptuous cool breath'd earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains misty- <br>topt!<br>Earth or the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged <br>with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer <br>for my sake!<br>Far swooping elbow'd earth—rich apple blossom'd earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes.<br>Prodigal, you have given me love—therefore I to you <br>give love!<br>O unspeakable passionate love.</p><p>And with equal joy he contemplates the gigantic black driver of a dray:</p><p>The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the<br>block swags underneath it on its tied-over chain,<br>The negro that drives the long dray of the stone yard,<br>steady and tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the string- <br>piece. <br>His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and<br>loosens over his hip band,<br>His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the<br>slouch of his hat away from his forehead.<br>The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on<br>the black of his polished and perfect limbs.</p><p>His idea of supreme beauty is man, at his best, in contact with nature—the naked body of the swimmer battling with the waves, the locomotive driving through the snowdrift, the woodsman swinging his broadaxe, the lusty farmer swinging his scythe, outdoor life, the ship at sea, muscle and pluck forever! No poet has ever echoed more accurately the whirr and roar of the restless, every-day life of the world, the infinitely complex movement of human activity, the rush of the planet through space, the resultant sound of all mingled sounds. This booms like the distant voice of the ocean in some of Goethe's lines, but Goethe never came nearer the laboratory of the universe than Whitman in 'Eidόlons':</p><p>Ever the dim beginning,<br>Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle,<br>Ever the summit and the merge at last (to surely start <br>again),<br>Eidόlons! Eidόlons!</p><p>Ever the mutable,<br>Ever materials changing, crumbling, re-cohering,<br>Ever the ateliers, the factories divine,<br>Issuing Eidόlons!</p><p>The misfortune is that Walt Whitman, not content with his discovery of the value of the spirit of the Nineteenth century and the Modern Man as poetic material, seeks to elevate it into a democratic philosophy, or new religion of humanity. That he regards himself as the prophet of new ideas which loom awfully, but somewhat vaguely, behind the framework of his verses, is shown by abundant evidence. It would perhaps puzzle him to write out in cold prose the cardinal points of his social and religious philosophy, or, having done so, to demonstrate that they contain anything more than the ancient commonplaces. The abstract idea of universal brotherhood, of which the kiss between man and man is his not agreeable poetic type, the equality of man with man and of man with God, some taking truisms afforded by an imperfect acquaintance with the literature of metaphysical thought, a constant insistence on the doctrines of stirpiculture, a firm conviction in the majesty of the People—is not this the sum of the new creed of which he declares himself over and over again the embodiment, and which leads him to the final audacity of a comparison of his own mission with that of Christ?</p><p>E. P. M.</p><p>'Leaves of Grass.' </p><p>Liberty has received from the publishers, and joyfully welcomes Leaves of Grass, the collective title of Walt Whitman's poems. It is a convenient, compact, and tastefully 'got up' volume of 382 pages, and contains a number of hitherto unpublished poems, besides those of the earlier editions. 'Leaves of Grass' have lost nothing of their original native simplicity, freshness, and vigor from being more carefully arranged and placed in a more artistic, though it may be a more conventional vase. The book will be more readily purchased and read, at any rate; and that is the main point. The titles of some of the poems have been changed, and the table of contents newly arranged and made much more convenient for reference to special passages.</p><p>We have not discovered that the book has lost anything of its characteristic outspoken independence, nor that any concession has been made to Mrs. Grundy.1 It still retains all its naked truthfulness and purity, like its prototype in marble, the Greek Slave.<p><p>Walt Whitman is preeminently, above all and before all, the poet of innovation, the poet of change, the poet of growth, the poet of evolution. There is not a drop of stagnant blood in his veins. Every fibre of him quivers with life, energy, and fire. His spirit is at the same time the spirit of content and discontent. He is satisfied with whatever is and as it is—for to-day, but not for to-morrow, nor that for any future to-morrow.</p><p>Urge and urge and urge, <br>Always the procreant urge of the world.</p><p>That seems to him to be the key-note of the universe.</p><p>A study, 'By Blue Ontario's Shore,' affords a good idea of what he himself considers his mission, and shows how thoroughly one in purpose that mission is with Liberty's. He shall speak for himself from that poem.</p><p>By Blue Ontario's shore,<br>As I mused of these warlike days and of peace return'd, and the <br>dead that return no more,<br>A Phantom gigantic superb, with stern visage accosted me,<br><em>Chant me the poem/</em> it said, <em>that comes from the sould of America, <br>Chant me the carol of victory, and strike up the marches of Lib- <br>ertad, marches more powerful yet, <br>And sing me before you go the song of the throes of Democracy. </em></p><p>The poet, in responding, commences with a striking bit of individual self-assertion, of which we can quote but a few lines:</p><p>A Nation announcing itself,<br>I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,<br>I reject none, accept all, then reporduce all in my own forms.</p><p>We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,<br>We are executive in ourselves,<br>We are sufficient in the variety of ourselves,<br>We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves,<br>Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,<br>Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or <br>sinful in ourselves only.</p><p>(O mother—O sisters dear!<br>If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us,<br>It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)</p><p>Have you thought there could be but a single supreme?<br>There can be any number of supremes . . . . <br>All is eligible to all,<br>All is for individuals, all is for you.</p><p>Produce great Persons, the rest follows.</p><p>Then comes this attack upon Authority and conservatism:</p><p>Piety and Conformity to them that like,<br>Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like,<br>I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,<br>Crying, Leap from your seats and contend for your lives;<br>I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue, questioning <br>every one I meet,<br>Who are you that wanted only to be told what you knew before?</p><p>Somewhat changing the theme:</p><p>I listened to the Phantom by Ontario's shore,<br>I heard the voice arising demanding bards,<br>By them all native and grand, by them alone can these States be <br>fused into the compact organism of a Nation.</p><p>To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is no <br>account,<br>That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living princi-<br>ple, as the hold of the limbs of the body or the fibres of plants.</p><p>Of these States the poet is the equable man,<br>For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,<br>For that, the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,<br>The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots.</p><p>Without extinction is Liberty, without retrograde is Equality,<br>They live in the feelings of young men and the best women,<br>(Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been <br>always ready to fall for Liberty.)</p><p>For the great Idea,<br>That, O my brethren, that is the mission of poets.</p><p>A few lines to show what he claims for himself:</p><p>Give me the pay I have served for,<br>Give me to sing the songs of the great Idea, take all the rest.<br>I have loved the earth, sun, animals, I have despised riches,<br>Claim'd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim'd for <br>others on the same terms,<br>I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of <br>myself,<br>Rejecting none, permitting all.</p><p>We must find room for our poet's creed of Individualism, and close therewith our quotations from this remarkable book:</p><p>I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things,<br>It is not the earth, it is not America who is so great,<br>It is I who am great or to be great, it is you up there, or any one,<br>It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,<br>Through poems, pageants, shows, to form individuals.</p><p>Underneath all, individuals,<br>I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,<br>The only government is that which makes minute of individuals,<br>The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one single <br>individual—namely to you.<br>(Talk as you like, he only suits these States whose manners favor <br>the audacity and sublime turbulence of the States.)<br>Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments, own-<br>erships, I swear I perceive other lessons,<br>Underneath all to me is myself, to you yourself, (the same monoto-<br>nous old song.)</p><br><p>I am for those that have never been master'd,<br>For men and women whose tempers have never been master'd,<br>For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master.<br>I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth,<br>Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all.</p><p>I will not be out-faced by irrational things,<br>I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me,<br>I will make cities and civilizations defer to me,<br>This is what I have learnt from America—it is the amount, and it I <br>teach again.</p><p>(Democracy, while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast,<br>I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children, saw in dreams <br>your dilating form,<br>Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)</p><p>I will confront these shows of the day and night,<br>I will know if I am to be less than they,<br>I will see if I am not as majestic as they,<br>I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they,<br>I will see if I am to be less generous than they,<br>I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have <br>meaning,<br>I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves, and <br>I am not to be enough for myself.</p><p>Walt Whitman's Claim to Be Considered a Great Poet. </p><p>———</p><p>Extracts From and Opinions On His 'Leaves of Grass.'</p><p>———</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS.</p><p>Walt Whitman has issued a new and complete edition of his poems, with the same title as that given to his first volume, published in 1855, and reissued at Camden, N. J., some twenty years later. In his volume all the objectionable passages which were the cause of so much complaint at the time of their first appearance are given entire without a word changed or omitted. It was said of Mr. Mallock by an English reviewer, that in his last novel he had introduced 'the beastly into literature.' Considering some of the unexpurgated lines in this volume, Mr. Whitman is entitled to the honorable position of the apostle of the beastly in poetry. Nothing that Swinburne—a kindred unclean spirit, of greater intellectual power, however—ever wrote compares with the foulness of some of the 'good gray poet's' verse. The lines might be appropriate over the portals of a bawdy house, but not in a volume of poetry from a respectable publishing firm, intended for general circulation.</p><p>Mr. Whitman has been so long silent that the leading facts in his career are generally forgotten. He is now in his 63d year, having been born in 1819 at West Hills, on Long Island. His father was an Englishman and his mother from Holland. During his life he has worked as printer, carpenter, school-teacher, army-nurse, and clerk in the office of the Attorney-General. He has traveled quite extensively, and has suffered of late years from partial paralysis. For a proper appreciation of his poetry a peculiarly cultured taste is required. Claiming to be a writer for and of the people, those to whom Whitman appeals have shown the least sympathy with him and the greatest ignorance of the inspirations of his muse. Possibly we do not comprehend Whitman. Certainly we fail to enjoy what he is pleased to call his poetry. To any of Carlyle's heavily-capitalized pages the same title might be applied with equal force. The difficulty is to understand why it would not be equally effective and striking if entitled 'prose.' Take as an instance the poem entitled 'Our Old Feuillage':</p><p>Always our old feuillage!<br>Always Florida's green peninsula—always the <br>priceless delta of Louisiana—always the cot- <br>ton-fields of Alabama and Texas,<br>Always California's golden hills, and hollows, and <br>the silver mountains of New Mexico—always <br>soft-breath'd Cuba,<br>Always the vast slope drain'd by the Southern <br>Sea, inseparable with the slopes drain'd by <br>the Eastern and Western Seas,<br>The eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast and <br>bay-coast on the main, the thirty thousand <br>miles of river navigation,<br>The seven millions of distinct families and the <br>same number of dwellings—always these, <br>and more, branching forth into numberless <br>branches,<br>Always the free range and diversity—always the <br>continent of Democracy;<br>Always the prairies, pastures, forests, vast <br>cities, travelers, Kanada the snows:<br>Always these compact lands tied at the hips <br>with the belt stringing the huge oval lakes—</p><p>Thus, in the same strain, this so-called poetry runs on for four pages without a single period! It is true that Walt Whitman has been praised by such high authorities in literature as Emerson, Tennyson, and Ruskin. Their eulogies, however, were rather on the thoughts and sentiments of the author than praise of his versification. His power is rugged and his controlling impulse, apart from his egotism, is to say whatever occurs to him at the moment, whether relevant or irrelevant. He lacks both rhyme and rhythm. His is imaginative, but not metrical, composition; the fruit of an excited imagination, but without measured form. If we call him a great poet, and judge him by his writings, where shall we assign our Longfellow or Whittier, tried on the same kind of evidence? Macaulay has as broad and liberal a definition of ars poetica as anyone. 'By poetry,' he says, 'we mean the art of employing words in such a manner as to produce an illusion on the imagination; the art of doing by means of words what the painter does by means of colors.' Now, if we take one or two of Walt Whitman's best efforts, how does he fulfill these requirements? Here is a little bit called 'Aboard at a Ship's Helm':</p><p>Aboard at a ship's helm,<br>A young steersman steering with care.</p><p>Through fog on a seacoast dolefully ringing,<br>An ocean-bell—O a warning bell rocked by the <br>waves.</p><p>O you give a good notice indeed, you bell by the <br>sea-reefs ringing,<br>Ringing, ringing, to warn the ship from its <br>wreck-place.</p><p>For as on the alert O steersman, you mind the <br>loud admonition.<br>The bows turn, the freighted ship tacking speeds <br>away under her gray sails,<br>The beautiful and noble ship with all her pre-<br>cious wealth speeds away gayly and safe.</p><p>But O the ship, the immortal ship! O ship aboard <br>the ship!<br>Ship of the body, ship of the soul, voyaging, <br>voyaging, voyaging.</p><p>Or take a few lines from another poem:</p><p>Sauntering the pavement or riding the country <br>by road, lo, such faces!<br>Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, <br>ideality,<br>The spiritual prescient face, the always welcome <br>common benevolent face,<br>The face of the singing of music, the grand faces <br>of natural lawyers and judges broad at the <br>back-top,<br>The faces of hunters and fishers, bulged at the <br>brows, the shaved blanched faces of ortho-<br>dox citizens,<br>The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning <br>artist's face,<br>The ugly face of some beautiful soul, the hand-<br>some detested or despised face.</p><p>This now is too lamentable a face for a man.<br>Some abject louse asking leave to be, cringing <br>for it,<br>Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it <br>wrig to its hole.<br>. . . . . . .</p><p>The face is a haze more chill than the Arctic sea,<br>Its sleepy and wabbling icebergs crunch as they <br>go.</p><p>Milton defines poetry as 'thoughts that voluntary move harmonious numbers'; and Chatfield says, 'Poetry is the music of thought, conveyed to us in the music of language.' Joubert happily puts it, 'Nothing which does not transport is poetry. The lyre is a winged instrument.' Let us see, then how a few lines from Whitman's 'Song of Myself' come up to the requirements of these authorities:</p><p>I celebrate myself, and sing myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs <br>to you.</p><p>I loafe and invite my soul,<br>I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of <br>summer grass.</p><p>My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd <br>from this soil, this air.<br>Born here of parents born here from parents <br>the same, and their parents the same,<br>I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,<br>Hoping to cease not till death.</p><p>Creeds and schools in abeyance,<br>Retiring back awhile sufficed at what they are, <br>but never forgotten,<br>I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at <br>every hazard,<br>Nature without check with original energy.</p><p>Take some of the shorter poems. Here is an ode to 'Beautiful Women':</p><p>Women sit or move to and fro, some old, some <br>young,<br>The young are beautiful—but the old are more <br>beautiful than the young.</p><p>Here is another, entitled 'Thought':</p><p>Of obedience, faith, adhesiveness;<br>As I stand aloof and look there is to me some-<br>thing profoundly affecting in large masses <br>of men following the lead of those who do <br>not believe in men.</p><p>Ruskin considers that 'It is a shallow criticism that would define poetry as confined to literary productions in rhyme and metre. The written poem is only poetry talking, and the statue, the picture, and the musical composition are poetry acting. Milton and Goethe, at their desks, were not more truly poets than Phidias with his chisel, Raphael at his easel, or deaf Beethoven bending over his piano, inventing and producing strains which he himself could never hope to hear'—and this great critic, Ruskin, say Whitman's admirers, has praised our hero! So be it! Phidias and Raphael and Beethoven were judged in accordance with the merits of what they produced. Their 'acted poetry' stood the test of the most acute analysis and was given prominent rank because it was perfection. In the same manner 'talking poetry,' by whoever written, must satisfy the eye, the ear, the mind, the heart, all the higher mental faculties in order to be classed as true, genuine inspired poetry. Does this short poem meet these demands:</p><p><em>A GLIMPSE</em><br>A Glimpse, through an interstice caught,<br>Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-<br>room around the stove late of a winter <br>night, and I unremark'd seated in a corner,<br>Or a youth who loves me and whom I love, <br>silently approaching and seating himself <br>near, that he may hold me by the hand,<br>A long while amid the noises of coming and <br>going, of drinking and oath and smutty <br>jest,<br>There we two, content, happy in being to-<br>gether, speaking little, perhaps not a word.</p><p>See how easily Whitman's verse becomes prose, and what would be the spontaneous criticism on any author who should write such prose:</p><p><em>WALT WHITMAN.</em><br>Thou orb aloft full-dazzling, thou hot October noon! Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand, the sibilant near sea with vistas far, and foam, and tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue; O sun of noon refulgent! My special word to thee. Hear me illustrious! Thy lover me, for always have I loved thee, even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some woodedge, thy touching-distant beams enough, or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I launch my invocation. Thou that with fructifying beat and light, o'er myriad farms, o'er land and waters North and South, o'er Mississippi's endless course, o'er Texas' grassy plains, Kanada's woods, o'er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining in space; thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents, seas; thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so liberally, shed, shed thyself on mine and me, but with a fleeting ray out of the million millions. Strike through these chants. Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these; prepare the later afternoon of me myself—prepare my lengthening shadows, prepare my starry nights.</p><p>There is no thought of melody, of the mechanical requirements of verse. It is simply a combination of words like unto the bits of glass in the child's kaleidoscope. Is it the language of a real genius or the voice of a ponderous fool? Whitman himself partially answers the question in a song from which we have already quoted. He is:</p><p>Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the <br>son,<br>Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, and<br> breeding.<br>No sentimentalist, no stander above men and <br>women, or apart from them.<br>No more modest than immodest.<br>. . . . . . <br>I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all <br>so luscious. </p><p>This is the pen picture of himself by the man claiming to be the apostle of a new art, instead of being really the apostle of a great art in its most degraded form. There is no necessity for further quotation. We can admire the native, rugged strength of Whitman's unhampered genius. His active, brilliant imagination and his far-reaching enthusiasm seeking expression in language—in words that shall fire the heart and excite the mind—are characteristics of an extraordinary nature. So too his command of language and, apparently inexhaustible vocabulary is remarkable in a man with such antecedents and personal history. But these qualities do not make him a great poet. And to rank him as such is, to our thinking, to establish an entirely new standard from that which we have been wont to apply to the great masters of song. If they are true poets, then is Whitman a false one; if he is a poetic genius, then were the most honored names of literature but poetasters and 'pitiful rhymers.' </p><p>Published in Boston by J. R. Osgood & Co. Advance sheets.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN, complete at last, thanks to the patience and pluck of James R.Osgood & Co., the Boston publishers, speaks to the world by his new book, just issued in such shape and under such auspices as will win the world's wider attention. The book is running over with the writer's own personality and the two must be treated as one. Walt and his work are older, whiter, more mature; not wiser, but quieter; the mad turbulence hushed a little and some pruning done; yet the same sight, undimmed, immortal; Leaves of Grass, still green and vital as ever, but now growing close about many a solid rock of fame; the man and his work, among the oddest, if not the most beautiful, things of the present century.</p><p>I, the Titan, the hard-mouthed mechanic, spending my <br>life in the hurling of words.</p><p>In an age of short hair, and cropped beards, and close-fitting contained 'pants,' and neck wear, a man that persists in letting his hair and beard grow long, wears loose clothing, low-necked shirts and no collar or hatter at all, out-Byrons Byron, and if he can do all this, as Whitman does, and still maintain his self-respect, and not get hooted at on every street corner, that is, keep on his own way without fastening upon himself the obloquy of a quack and charlatan, it argues pretty strongly that there is unusual stuff in the animal somewhere. And the man who can name three hundred little songs and songlets, and somehow permeate each name with instinctive life that laughs at commonplace and each name an original fixed streak of genius in its way, not only not dull, but vividly descriptive, suggestive, is something out of the ordinary ranks of hacks in all lines. As to the poems, Emerson long ago said they were poetry; Tennyson, Swinburne, not to speak of vapid critics at home or abroad, affirm that Walt has written poetry. What is there left to be said? Much every day were there room to say it. Short and clear let the words be. It would be easy to pick a thousand lines from Whitman's three hundred and eighty-two pages that fairly breathe and bristle with power, that sparkle and flash with beauty, that are as unique in modern poetry as the brightest aurora that has filled the north skies for a generation and as rare as the few gem-like days of June. Now and then there are eclipses; sunlight and stars all gone out of the man and his word; but nature swings back to him, lo to it, and there is light again when the orbit is bound and nature attuned. It is life, seen and recorded. Never mind the egotism. That must come in somehow in all work. To jot it down more definitely, Whitman has eyes, looks into things, not at them. No long or steady gaze, no masterful comprehension of the great laws of the facts, but the facts he sees; furthermore, has the ability to report the fact as he sees it, as it is; yet further, to saturate all facts so seen and recorded with the momentary intense splendor of his own being. Name the being? The grade of it? Well, not Homeric; that was warlike, heroic, grand. Read the lines of Whitman's face and of his poetry: nothing of the Homeric or heroic is there. Not Shakespearean; that is art incarnate. Whitman is not an artist; not Virgilic or Dantic—that is culture and morality and sentiment and piety of a kind. Whitman has none of these. Not Emersonian or Tennysonian—that is scholarly—Whitman is the farthest removed from all that. What then? We answer, that what these all were to the distinctive spirit of their generations, though in utter contrast with them, Whitman is to the characteristic spirit of this generation—gigantic, rude, loud, prosy, mechanic, conceited. Whirling, unsettled, abounding in vitality, extent and power. In this light read Whitman's book, and lines fine, in their way, as any in Homer or Shakespeare shall flash on your soul, if you have a soul, and pleasure rich and rare as the lover finds in love, the poet in nature, and the banker in his margins shall press and pierce you almost to pain.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS. </p><p>Since the issue, years ago, of a strange, thin volume, bearing this title, the thinkers of the world have been busy in attempting to read the riddle of these poems and their author. The struggle has raged fiercely about every point, from the question whether the term 'poem' can properly be applied to these odd recitatives at all, to the question of their meaning and their inspiration. The complete works of Walt Whitman are now put into the hands of the old generation and the new, to do what work they may; but by this time criticism should have crystallized into something definite, and the world ought not longer to go on wondering, each man scanning the face of his neighbor before venturing upon an opinion of his own. And first, let the old quarrel about the form of these poems be finally dismissed. The question of the fittest form for the expression of poetic ideas is as old as human thought, and different ages and nations have answered it differently. The modern rules of rhyme and accent would have seemed senseless to the Latin or Greek prosodists. All these matters are mere conventionalities; and if a man's genius direct him to write in measures hitherto unknown, why let him be judged independently of what are little more than the literary fashions of the day. Whitman's chants strike rudely on the ear at first; but there is in their very construction an element of the magnificent old Hebrew rhythm which marks the book of Job the grandest of epics. They are not mere accidental jumbles. The reader with an ear for music will detect a theme running through them all, which will satisfy him as well, if he be a thoughtful man, as if he could scan them glibly by anapests or trochees. That Whitman is a great poet, it does not require a long reading to discover. From this volume could be collected more absolutely fresh instances of that creative genius which is the progenitor of poetry than from any writer of modern times. Metaphors of singular fidelity and beauty, such as 'the fan-shaped explosions,' crowd upon and round out the lines. Who that has ever heard it can forget this one?—'The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp.' Many of his short poems are as clean-cut as crystals, and as melodious as more strictly measured cadences. The 'Drum Taps' are famous everywhere; and, though later efforts have been less happy, the one exquisite song, 'O, Captain! My Captain!' written on the death of Lincoln, would make him one of our honored poets forever. When mere formal objections are laid by, the most obvious surface criticism upon Whitman is his apparent egotism. It is everywhere 'I,' 'me imperturbe,' 'I project the history of the future,' 'You do not understand me, you cannot understand me, but I can wait hundreds of years for my audience, and they will understand and applaud me.' If these were merely the mouthings of individual pride, they would inspire deserved disgust. But they are the words of a man who has a message and proves it. Everywhere, to him who reads aright, the personality of the prophet is sunk out of sight, and the prophecy is exalted. This man feels that he has a message to the multitudinous generations. The grandeur of humanity, the oneness of creation, the beauty and the glory in that one word, 'life,' the meanness of social and artificial distinctions, the grand eternal sweep of cosmic laws, the dignity of everything that is, simply because it is, and the onward march of all things mean and great toward a wondrous destiny,—these are the high thoughts which reduce language almost to incoherence, and fill the seer with unutterable exaltation. Is not this the true humility of one who thinks much of his message and little of himself?—</p><p>The words of my book nothing, the drift of it <br>everything. <br>A book separate, not link'd with the rest nor felt <br>by the intellect, <br>But you ye untold latencies, will thrill to every <br>page.</p><p>His sympathy with everything in nature bea[rs] marks of that higher pantheism to which modern scientific and religious thought distinctly tend. His sinking of self, in the midst of seeming self-glorification, is the poet's tribute to the race. His apparently intuitive grasp of truth toward which knowledge laboriously gropes, has been firmly shown by Professor Clifford in his essay on 'Cosmic Emotion.' The wonderful new light that shines to-day upon poems written twenty years ago and since unchanged, but then unintelligible, is a better vindication of the inspiration behind them than all the work of critics and reviewers. Does any man claim that Whitman is weakly atheistic?</p><p>I say no man has ever yet been half devout <br>enough,<br>None has every yet adored or worship'd half <br>enough,<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself <br>is, and how certain the future is.<br>All the things of the universe are perfect mir-<br>acles, each as profound as any.<br>The wonder is always and always how there can <br>be a mean man or an infidel.</p><p>He is religious enough, though not with the faith of the creeds. 'Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation.' He looks through nature to ultimate forces and exults in them.</p><p>And as to you Death, and you bitter tug of mortal-<br>ity, it is idle to try to alarm me.<br>And as to you Life, I reason you are the leavings of <br>many deaths.<br>I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,<br>O suns—O grass of graves—O perpetual transfers <br>and promotions.</p><p>He is, indeed a poet who sees far and keenly; and no doubt the reader of the future will believe it still more than we. One other current objection must be briefly met. Public and publishers have cried out upon his indecency. It is true that there are in this book things which no man observant of conventions would have dared to print. But it must be said of them, as he says of his poems, that the words are nothing, the tendency everything. His lines are bold and startling, but you can look them through and through and find no prurient suggestiveness. His aim is to glorify human nature as God made it, with powers complete but undefiled. Delicate modesty feeds upon Swinburne, but flees with down-drawn eyelids from Whitman; yet the pages of the latter are to those of the former what a gallery of Greek sculpture, filled with noble, life-like, marble figures, is to the cancan upon the stage of the Paris Varieties. The real, consistent criticisms upon Leaves of Grass have been uttered, if at all, but by few and with hesitation. Whitman seems to have in undue amount the author's tenderness, born perhaps, in this case, of his sense of the greatness of his mission, for every word he has written; and this has prevented the exclusion of worthless matter. The few lines, for instance, entitled The Ship Starting, contain neither thought nor figure of beauty that entitle them to life. And in his longer poems the tiresome enumerations of States, countries and avocations, which sometimes spread over pages, are but the wanderings of heated imagination and vivid fancy, detracting from both the inner thought and the outer artistic effect. To cut down the volume probably one-fourth, if judiciously done, would exclude nothing of present or possible future value. The constant use of such words as 'ostent,' 'sidle,' 'sluing,' and the like, is bad English and worse taste. Again, he is open to the charge of making his thought unnecessarily obscure. Doubtless he himself cannot grasp in their fullness all the mighty ideas which float illusively before him. He is like a child attempting to describe Niagara, or like him who could not utter a word of the things he saw and heard, when caught up to heaven in a vision. But he is, nevertheless, unnecessarily mystic and incoherent. Those who have penetrated to the heart of one of his Delphic sayings can see that its intent was purposely shrouded in vague, verbal involutions. Not only might he have sooner won his place, but he might have done better the work in which he glories, had he courted the strong simplicity which none is better able to master. Leaves of Grass has won its own way, and is sure of its place. Few American authors have the reputation abroad which Whitman has attained. At home he is destined to a closer and more admiring study as the years go by. From such a discipline it is not impossible that a greater future poet may draw virility and inspiration, while avoiding errors which impair the strength and the popular influence of a work unique, original, careless of standards and traditions, yet replete with beauty and power.</p><p>[ . . .] We have read anew, from a sense of duty, the original and unexpurgated Leaves of Grass, by Walt Whitman, as now reprinted, with some milder additions (Osgood). It cannot be said of them, as Sir Charles Pomander, in 'Christie Johnstone,' says of his broken statues, that 'time has impaired their indelicacy.' This somewhat nauseating quality remains in full force, and we see no good in their publication except to abate the outcries of the Liberal League against Mr. Anthony Comstock and his laws respecting obscene publications. So long as Leaves of Grass may be sent through the mails, the country is safe from over-prudery, at least. Mr. Whitman is often ranked with the 'fleshly school,' and his circle of English admirers is almost identical with the coterie whose apostles are Swinburne and Wilde. But the erotic poems of these authors are to those of Whitman as rose-water to vitriol. The English poets have at their worst some thin veneering of personal emotion; with Whitman there seems no gleam of anything personal, much less of that simple, generous impulse which makes almost every young man throw some halo of ideal charm about the object of his adoration. Whitman's love, if such it can be called, is the sheer animal longing of sex for sex—the impulse of the savage, who knocks down the first woman he sees, and drags her to his cave. On the whole, the condition of the savage seems the more wholesome, for he simply gratifies his brute lust and writes no resounding lines about it. </p><p>Leaving this disagreeable aspect of the matter, we are impressed anew, on reading these poems, by a certain quality of hollowness, which is nowhere more felt than in the strains called 'Drum-Taps.' It would be scarcely worth while to bring these strains to any personal test, perhaps, did not Mr. Whitman's admirers so constantly intrude his personality upon us; but we cannot quite forget what Emerson says, that 'it makes a great difference to a sentence whether there be a man behind it or no.' When Mr. Whitman speaks with utter contempt of the 'civilian' (p. 252), and claps the soldier on the back as 'camerado' (p. 251), we cannot help thinking of Thackeray's burly and peaceful Jos. Sedley at Brussels, just before the battle of Waterloo, striding and swaggering between two military officers, and looking far more warlike than either. One can be aroused to some enthusiasm over the pallid shop-boy or the bookish undergraduate who knew no better than to shoulder his musket and march to the front in the war for the Union; but it is difficult to awaken any such emotion for a stalwart poet, who—with the finest physique in America, as his friends asserted, and claiming an unbounded influence over the 'roughs' of New York—preferred to pass by the recruiting-office and take service in the hospital with the non-combatants.</p><p>When we come to purely intellectual traits, it is a curious fact that Mr. Whitman, by the production of one fine poem, has overthrown his whole poetic theory. Dozens of pages of his rhythmic prose are not worth 'My Captain,' which among all his compositions comes the nearest to accepting the restraints of ordinary rhyme. His success in this shows that he too may yet be compelled to recognize form as an element in poetic power. The discovery may have come too late, but unless he can regard its lessons he is likely to leave scarcely a complete work that will be remembered; only here and there a phrase, an epithet, a fine note—as when the midnight tolling for General Garfield is called 'The sobbing of the bells.' These are the passages which his especial admirers style 'Homeric,' but which we should rather call Ossianic. The shadowy Gaelic bard rejected the restraints of verse, like Whitman, and reiterated his peculiar images with wearisome diffuseness and minuteness. To be sure, he was not an egotist, and he kept within the limits of decency; but he gave fine glimpses and pictures, while there was always a certain large, free atmosphere about all his works. They were translated into all languages; he was ranked with Homer and Virgil; Goethe and Napoleon Bonaparte were his warm admirers—and the collections of English poetry do not now include a line of his composing. If Whitman, after the same length of time, proves more fortunate, it will be because he wrote 'My Captain.'</p><p>Extremes meet, and many of Mr. Whitman's admirers are also enamored of the peculiarly hot-house atmosphere of Mr. Rossetti. We may be mistaken, but we see in his new volume a healthier strain than before, both in the sonnets added and in the subtraction of others. [ . . .]</p><p>THE FIRST AMERICAN POET. </p><p>———</p><p>Walt Whitman—Justice at last—A Great Poet Completes a Great Work.</p><p>———</p><p>The announcement was made some time ago that Walt Whitman was in Boston personally superintending the publication of his poems under the title of 'Leaves of Grass,' the name used in issuing his first thin volume, which threw all the conventional critics into spasms of laughter and disgust. But twenty years have wrought a mighty change. Whitman has steadily grown in favor in Europe and hence his own countrymen have taken him up and have gradually come to see that a great and original poet has been among them.</p><p>James R. Osgood & Co., of Boston, have just issued a volume of 382 pages containing Whitman's complete works. It is now discovered that from the beginning the poet had a purpose to which he has steadily adhered; that for thirty years he has been laboring on a great work with one aim, and that what seemed fragmentary were the parts of a great whole, the segments of a mighty circle, which the purblind public could not see or comprehend at one view.</p><p>The Pioneer Press a few days ago noticed these poems in a column article, doing justice to the poems and the poet. From England and America we expect to hear a reversal of the judgment of the flippant and shallow critics of twenty years ago and henceforth Walt Whitman will take a permanent place in history as the father and founder of a distinctively American literature.</p><p>We rejoice at this, for we were among those who first hailed Whitman as a poetic star of great magnitude rising over the horizon. In the year 1860, we published a literary paper called 'The Fireside,' in which we devoted a page to Whitman, quoting from the Westminster Review an adverse criticism and taking issue with the shallow reviewer. The British review thus spoke of the poems:</p><p>In form these poems, if poems they can be called, are composed of irregular rhythmical lines, after the manner of Tupper, and in fact they may be described by the following equation: as Tupper is to English Humdrum, so is Walt Whitman to American Rowdy.</p><p>That a drunken Helot should display himself without shame in the market place, speaks sad reproach to the public that does not scourge him back to his cellar.</p><p>To this the Cincinnati Commercial added:</p><p>This is deserved, and yet there are dirty dogs and dunces who praise Whitman's indecency, and call him a 'masculine poet' because he is an obscure ass.</p><p>In reply to this we said twenty-one years ago, page 106 of the 'Fireside':</p><p>Nevertheless, Walt Whitman is a poet. We expected better things of the Westminster Review. The above is of that shallow kind of criticism which flounders about on the surface and cannot reach down and feel the drift and great undercurrent of a work. Whitman is as much a word-painter as Bryant and a great deal more original, simple and masculine. No writer has ever given such a complete and natural picture of the external life of America. The man who is too much shocked by its 'indecency' to find any beauty in 'Leaves of Grass,' must have a very tasty taste. Whitman is a poet, but a poet rather in the rough.</p><p>We envy Mr. Conway, of the 'Dial,' his remark, viz: 'Walt Whitman has set the pulses of America to music.' There is more justness and appreciation, and comprehensive criticism in that short sentence than in all the conservative critics have said about Whitman.</p><p>We well remember how the 'thothiety' editors and the smart youths whose conception of poetry extended only to 'Marco Bozzaris' and 'Hohenlinden' jeered at these poems! How they referred to the poet himself as a product of the 'Brooklyn Flats' and as the 'red-shirted omnibus driver' of the metropolis. Yet Walt Whitman has made a profound impression on his time. And while he will probably not be generally read any more than Chaucer is. Yet the time will come when Whitman will be looked upon as the father of an American literature, that is of a literature distinctively and in all respects American, without any kingly, or monarchical or European influences in it.—He has laid the foundations, started the idea, of a genuine Democratic, New World, thoroughly American literature, and after him will come some great poet who will be the Shakspeare to this Chaucer. Moreover he is a genuine American man, the most original and truest Democrat of his time. The man is greater than his poems. His works, as the expression of a thoroughly original, democratic, human being, are invaluable, and on this foundation some mighty genius hereafter will build a literature and the gates of hell and time shall not prevail against it. Longfellow, Bryant, Whittier, Lowell and the rest will be remembered in the Cyclopedias as poets who did creditable work in English literature, but Whitman and his class will loom over the future as the founders and makers of an American literature.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS BY WALT WHITMAN.

Several magazines and newspapers, which either received the words of 'the Good Gray Poet' with abuse, or refused to allow their pages to be sullied with a notice of his 'monstrosities,' now welcome his life-work with little short of unstinted praise. Nor is this due to the fact that a great publishing house gives its imprint to the title page. The reason lies deeper. While upon some natures his name still has the effect of the traditional red rag upon the angry bull, the majority of cultivated minds begin to see that Walt Whitman is the most American of poets and one of the brightest lights of American literature. It is worth while, then, for even very briefly to examine some of the adverse criticisms that have been passed upon Mr. Whitman, and to see how much weight they really have.</p><p>First, it is said that the form into which he throws his verse is chaotic, that his poems run to 'a chaos of monotonies,' and hence his book makes war upon all theories of true poetry. The same criticism would shut out of the category the English Psalms of David, and the best and most satisfactory translations of Homer and the Greek dramatists, Virgil and Dante, Goethe and Victor Hugo. These authors are still poets in the most literal translation, and the man who can read Whitman and find no rhythm lacks a musical ear. He has the most astounding variety of meters suited to every slightest change of sentiment, here lilting like a smooth flowing river, here carrying the reader along with all the rush of a Niagara, and again blocking itself with wonderful expressiveness. A study of Whitman's meters would be no more interesting and instructive than that which is spent on the complicated, and to us moderns the meaningless, systems of the Greek strophe and antistrophe. Take these four lines from 'A Broadway Pageant.' They are worthy of Horace:</p><p>'Over the Western sea hither from Niphon come,<br>Courteous, the swart-cheek'd two-sworded envoys,<br>Leaning back in their open barouches, bare-headed, <br>impassive,<br>Ride to-day through Manhattan.'</p><p>And hundreds of other instances could be given. Again, it is said that the catalogues with which Walt Whitman loads his poems are unpoetical. Without attempting to argue the point it may be said that were all records of America destroyed and Walt Whitman's poems preserved, the daily life of the nineteenth century might be pictured with almost photographic accuracy from the same much-abused catalogues; and, moreover, if anyone reads them understandingly he will not fail to be impressed with their picturesqueness and contrast their felicity of descriptiveness, and, taken in connection with the plan of the whole work, their appropriateness. And this brings us to a third adverse criticism: That the work has no unity of plan. To a narrow conception this is true. It needs a wide perspective, and, if these poems had been left to us by an ancient bard, they would have been prized as the most precious memorial of the past. The old story of the sculptor is not inapplicable here. Seen from a level at a short distance the statue appeared monstrous and coarse; but when erected upon its proper height, the rude lines melted into softness and the coarse features were seen to be simply majestic. His boldness of touch is admirable; his pages are veritable panoramas of life; his observation is all-embracing; nothing fails in the picture, and he is equally at home on the wide plains of the West, the wind-swept 'gray beach' of the Paumanok shore, or amid the eddying swarms of the city. His adjectives are often worthy of Homer, and his view of the universe wider than Goethe's. </p><p>A common charge against Mr. Whitman, is that of his overweening vanity. It must be admitted that if his every utterance be taken as the expression of his personal individual feeling, vanity could not go further; it would be the acme of conceit. But this again is a narrow view. Mr. Whitman symbolizes himself in the grandeur, the spread, the vast liberty of the man. It is the ideal of self-conscious Pantheism. 'The Song of Myself,' is not Walt Whitman in any small way. Myself is man idealized, and every pleasure, every passion, every pain which goes to make up the life of the world, is centred upon him as a sentient being capable of all things. Looked upon ideally, therefore, there is no conceit in it; aside from its form, it is the grandest conception of poetry which this century has given, and, if read without prejudice, cannot fail to stir the heart. The egotism is the egotism of the poet, and may be seen in these lines from the greatest of the Welsh bards, which bear a curious similarity in form to Mr. Whitman's poems, though possessing individuality of their own:</p><p>'Primary chief bard am I to Elphin,<br>And my original country is the region of the Sum-<br>mer Stars.<br>I was with my Lord in the highest sphere,<br>On the fall of Lucifer into the depth of hell;<br>I have borne a banner before Alexander;<br>I know the names of the stars from North to South;<br>I have been on the Milky Way at the throne of the <br>Distributor;<br>I have been winged by the genius of the splendid <br>crozier;<br>I have been loquacious prior to being gifted with<br>speech;<br>I am a wonder whose origin is not known;<br>I have been in Asia with Noah in the ark;<br>I have seen the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra;<br>I have been with my Lord in the manger of the ass;<br>I have been in the armament with Mary Magda-<br>lene;<br>I have suffered hunger for the Son of the Virgin;<br>I have been fostered in the land of the Deity;<br>I am teacher to all intelligences;<br>I am able to instruct the whole universe;<br>I shall be until the day of doom on the face of the <br>earth;<br>And it is not known whether my body is flesh or <br>fish.'</p><p>And it is said that when Taliesin had finished his song, the kings who heard it were filled with marvel. </p><p>A still further objection, and the most serious one which has been urged against Mr. Whitman, is on the score of morality. It is claimed that he sins against purity, that he is the poet of the phallus and unbridled lust and indecency. Such a charge is extravagant. The lines which could be condemned on such a plea bear but a small proportion to the rest, and it may be said in defense that were its immodesty to shut it out from libraries, the Bible, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Goethe, and most of the master-pieces of literature would have to suffer in the same way. Again, it was not written for babes and sucklings, and the person who can get food for vile imaginings from it would be fed equally from a thousand other sources; honi soit qui mal y pense. It can hurt no true man or woman. As regards the question of taste, the chemical view of matter which can reduce a vile and a pleasant odor, rot and sweet, smut and diamond-dust to the same elements is not the most conducive to poetry, and here it seems as though Mr. Whitman failed. Granting his premises that 'If any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred,' still personal preferences, the love of the beautiful, the true, the high, the noble, the best that is meant in the word 'taste,' is also a part of human nature and therefore superior to the excremental, the disagreeably physical view of man. Mr. Whitman might have consistently taken this ground and raised his poems immeasurably in the eyes of the world which he claims to love, by expunging a few expressions which cannot fail to offend the taste of the reader. Some think it a greater sin to break the laws of good taste than those of morality. Moreover, it is a question whether the attempt to carry out his colossal plan of depicting humanity in its every phase is worth while, since it places his most stimulating, most inspired and grandest utterances out of the kin of the very boys and girls who are growing up into the future men and women, which his verse exalts. We believe in an expurgated Bible, an expurgated Shakespeare and an expurgated Whitman, at least for the use of the young. The question of Mr. Whitman's sins against the English language is of less consequence. Good taste would alter a few; others which make the critics howl are legitimate if North and South, East and West and the [sic] all the French, German, Spanish elements of our country be taken [into] consideration.</p><p>We have assumed all along that Mr. Whitman is a poet. Some critics deny this, but we venture to say that had Leaves of Grass come down to us from antiquity, it would be the universal claim that they had the sweep and magnificence of the epic and the variety and expression of the lyric. There are poems in 'Drum Taps' which stir the heart like a bugle:</p><p>'Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow.<br>Through the windows, through doors, burst like a <br>ruthless force,<br>Into the solemn church and scatter the congrega-<br>tion,<br>Into the school where the scholar is studying;<br>Leave not the bridegroom quiet—no happine[ss]<br>must he have with his bride,<br>Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing [his] <br>field or gathering his grain,<br>So fierce you whirr and pound yon drum—so sh[gap] <br>yon bugles blow.'</p><p>King David would not have been ashamed [of] this psalm:</p><p>'Proud music of the storm,<br>Blast that careers so fine, whistling among the [gap] <br>ries,<br>Strong hum of forest tree-tops—wind of the [moun-] <br>tains,<br>Personified dim shapes—you hidden [gap]<br>You serenades of phantoms with instru[gap]<br>Blinding with Nature's rhythmus all th[gap] <br>nations;<br>You chords left as by vast composers [gap]<br>You formless, tree, religious dan[gap] <br>Orient,<br>You undertone of rivers, roar of [gap]<br>You sounds from distant [gap] <br>Cavalry.<br>Echoes of camps, with all th[gap]<br>Trooping tumultuous, all[gap] <br>bending me powerless[gap]<br>Entering my lonesome [gap] <br>You seized me?'</p><p>Without even [gap] any definite way [gap] hesitate to place [gap] 'though you are.' Some of Whitman's readers have fancied that of late he would have been glad to omit some of the Adamic verse but for pride; and have in fact felt as if his theory of poetry might be the in some measure invented to fit the facts and justify them, rather than have been the source and mold of them. As good a thing as has ever been said of Whitman's work in this direction is contained in a review in a previous number of the Critic. Speaking of the old 'dilettante atmosphere' of our literature, without vital connection with the life of the country, the reviewer says—</p><p>'Into this hot-house air of literature Walt Whitman bounded, with the vigor and suppleness of a clown at a funeral. Dire were the grimaces of the mourners in high places, and dire are their grimaces still. There were plenty of criticisms to make, even after one had finished crying Oh! at the frank sensuality, the unbelievable nakedness of Walt. Everything that decent folk covered up, Walt exhibited, and boasted of exhibiting! He was proud of his nakedness and sensuality. He cried, Look here, you pampered rogues of literature, what are you squirming about, when you know, and everybody knows, that things are just like this, always have been, always will be? But it must be remembered that this is what he wrote, and that he did it with a plan, and by order from his genius. It has never been heard of him that he was disgusting in talk or vile in private life, while it has been known that poets celebrated for the lofty tone of their morality, for the strictness of their Christianity, the purity of their cabinet hymns, can condescend in private life to wallow in all that is base.'</p><p>Well worth quoting, before we leave the two great Americans, is what Walt says of Emerson: 'Amid the utter delirium-disease called bookmaking, its feverish cohorts filling our world with every form of dislocation, morbidity, and special type of anemia or exceptionalism (with the propelling idea of getting the most possible money, first of all), how comforting to know of an author who has, through a long life, and in spirit, written as honestly, spontaneously and innocently as the sun shines or the wheat grows—the truest, sanest, most moral, sweetest literary man on record—unsoiled by pecuniary or any other warp—ever teaching the law within—ever loyally outcropping his own self only—his own poetic and devout soul!'</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS. </p><p>———</p><p>Walt Whitman's Poems of Nature.</p><p>'A child said, What is the grass, fetching it to me <br>with full hands;<br>How could I answer the child? I do not know <br>what it is any more than he<br>—I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord<br>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly <br>dropt<br>Bearing the owner's name some way in the corn-<br>ers that we may remark and say Whose?<br>—And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut <br>hair of graves.'</p><p>There never was a happier title than the one which is the caption of this paper, nor one that has attracted more attention in the American world of literature. It is the title of a book that has been challenged by the conservers of public morals as unfit to be read, and legislation has been appealed to unsuccessfully to prohibit its publication. As usual in such cases, the reaction increased the demand for the book to such an extent that several new editions have been called for and it is found on the shelves of book stores side by side with Longfellow and Tennyson, in the home and in public libraries, where the critical reader or student of verse can have access to it, and the human nature that can suffer from any undue license of the poetic imagination which Walt Whitman has transcribed on these pages must be very weak indeed and easily harmed.</p><p>There is not a line of prefatory writing in Leaves of Grass, not a foot note to clear up the passages in nature which God has left obscure; the writer does not explain that the poems were a result of a few idle hours or the reveries of an invalid convalescing from an attack of mania a potu or typhoid fever; he pours out his thoughts about everything in a flood of incoherent and incohesive language, and borne on its resistless flow we find all that floods bear with them, debris, flotsam jewels—tarns of still deep beauty jewels—precious, perishing lovely things that we haste to snatch from the rubbish and make our own. His interest in humanity and his claim that all the world is kin, he expresses with natural humility:</p><p>These are really the thoughts of all men in all <br>ages and lands, they are not original with me;<br>If they are not yours as much as mine they are <br>nothing or next to nothing;<br>If they are the riddle and the untying of the <br>riddle, they are nothing or next to nothing;<br>This is the grass that grows wherever the land is <br>and the water is;<br>This is the common air that bathes the globe.</p><p>Can any pen-picture of nature be finer than his apostrophe to the earth on page 76? </p><p>'Smile O voluptuous cool-breathed earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunsets—earth of the mount-<br>ains misty top!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just <br>tinged with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and <br>clearer for my sake!<br>Far-swooping elbowed earth—rich apple-blos- <br>somed earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes.<br>Prodigal, you have given me love—therefore I to <br>you give love.<br>O unspeakable passionate love!</p><p>There seems to be no earthly property however small, insignificant and remote, that this grand poet of nature does not invest with the beauty and glory of poesy as he does when he calls the common field grass 'the beautiful uncut hair of graves,' a line that in itself should immortalize him; he walks among the herds of cattle and gives us this lesson:</p><p>'I think I could turn and live with animals, they <br>are so placid and self-contained,<br>I stand and look at them long and long;<br>They do not sweat and whine about their condi-<br>tion;<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and whine <br>about their sins;<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty <br>to God.<br>Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with <br>the mania of owning things.<br>Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that <br>lived thousands of years ago;<br>Not one is respectable or unhappy over the <br>whole earth.'</p><p>The self-elected critic who said that Shakespeare was not a poet—his verses didn't rhyme—would make a similar objection to Walt Whitman. To the dull, untuned ear of the prosaic soul they would convey neither rhythm nor rhyme, but Poetry herself might sit entranced at his feet as the mellow numbers flow in tranquil rhythmic measure from his lips. Here are snatches selected at random, any one of which would be sufficient to redeem a volume from wastage:</p><p>The old face of the mother of many children, <br>Whist! I am fully content.</p><p>Behold a woman:<br>She looks out from her quaker cap, her face is <br>clearer and more beautiful than the sky.</p><p>She sits in an arm-chair under the shaded porch <br>of the farm-house.</p><p>The sun just shines on her old white head.<br>Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen.<br>Her grandsons raised the flax, and her grand-<br>daughters spun it with the distaff and the <br>wheel.</p><p>The melodious character of the earth,<br>The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go <br>and does not wish to go.</p><p>The justified mother of men.</p><p><em>MOTHER AND BABE.</em><br>I see the sleeping babe nestling the breast of <br>its mother,<br>The sleeping mother and babe—hush'd, I study <br>them long.</p><p><em>A CHILD'S AMAZE.</em><br>Silent and amazed, even when a little boy,<br>I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday <br>put God in his statements<br>As contending against some being or influence.</p><p><em>BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.</em><br>Women sit, or move to and fro—some old, <br>some young.<br>The young are beautiful; but the old are more <br>beautiful than the young.</p><p>The poet's allusions to death are among the finest passages in his works, and his songs of parting are something more than tricks of pathos; they are the outcome of sorrow's cleansing fires in his own heart. The Camps of Green is a poem engendered by war scenes.</p><p>'To the camps of the tents of green,<br>Which the days of peace kept filling, <br>And the days of war kept filling.<br>With a mystic army; is it too ordered<br>Forward? is it too only halting awhile,<br>Till night and sleep pass over?</p><p><em>JOY, SHIPMATE, JOY!</em><br>Joy, shipmate, joy.<br>Pleased to my soul at death I cry<br>Our life is closed, our life begins<br>The long, long anchorage we leave;<br>The ship is clear at last she leaps,<br>She swiftly courses from the shore<br>Joy, shipmate, joy.</p><p>The exquisitely mournful tribute to the memory of President Lincoln is familiar [to] the reader but it will bear producing here.</p><p><em>O CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN!</em><br>O Captain, my Captain! our fearful trip is done<br>The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we <br>sought is won<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all <br>exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel <br>grim and daring;</p><p>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>O the bleeding drops of red,<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>O Captain, my Captain, rise up and hear the bells.<br>Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the <br>bugle trills,<br>For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you <br>the shore a crowding,<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager <br>faces turning.</p><p>Here Captain, dear father<br>This arm beneath your head<br>Is it some dream that on the deck<br>You've fallen cold and dead?</p><p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale <br>and still<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse <br>nor will<br>The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage <br>closed and done<br>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with <br>object won.</p><p>Exult O shores, and ring O bells,<br>But I with mournful tread<br>Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>To analyze a flower is to kill it; the same might be said of the majority of even fine poems, but there are some that dissected fall into pictures and the above is one of these; the two lines</p><p>'Here, captain, dear father,<br>This arm beneath your head'</p><p>have the heroism of a soldier and the tenderness of a woman in them, while they instantly convey to the mind a picture, alas! too common to excite alarm or wonder, but inexpressively touching. It has been Walt Whitman's destiny to commemorate in verse the deaths of two captains of the ship of state, but to him the first was a personal loss. Of the last, midnight, September 19, he writes of</p><p>The sobbing of the bells—<br>—Those heart-beats of a nation in the night</p><p>Emerson appears to have accepted the poet, if we may believe the assertion of an unknown writer that he approved of Leaves of Grass. It would need one of Emersonian breadth to appreciate the vigor, the intensity, the strong balancing of all mental and physical forces in this redundancy of verse. The book is full of such salt-sea breezes of expression as these:</p><p>O the joy of a manly selfhood!<br>To be servile to none to defer to none, not to any <br>tyrant known or unknown;<br>To walk with erect carriage, a step springy <br>and elastic;<br>To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye;<br>To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a <br>broad chest;<br>To confront with your personality all the other <br>personalities of the earth.'</p><p>That verse or sentence alone could be profitably engraved upon the pages of every school reader in the land, yet doubtless there are hypercritical readers who would cavil at the second line and find in it a furtive attack on all the known systems of theology.</p><p>And is there nothing in the book to condemn? Yes, there are whole pages of 'magnificent uncleanness' which have no excuse for being. They are gross with the grossness of the 18th century, when people do not call a spade a spade, and are shocked by ungloved hands. In reference to the position which a part of the public has taken towards the book we are reminded of the answer Henry Ward Beecher gave to a gentleman who at an exhibition of statuary asked, 'Are those statues indecent, Mr. Beecher?'</p><p>'No, sir,' was the severe answer, 'but your question is.'</p><p>The poet is an old man now, the fires of youth have burned themselves to ashes, yet when he was called upon to revise the present edition of his work he would not alter or omit a line of his earlier writings. The calm pulse of age approved the turbulent blood of his youth when he wrote of himself:</p><p>Walt Whitman, a Kosmos, of Manhattan the <br>son<br>Turbulent, fleshly, sensual, eating, drinking and <br>breeding<br>No sentimentalist, no stander above men and <br>women, or apart from them,<br>No more modest or immodest.<br>A morning glory at my window satisfies me more <br>than the metaphysics of books.'</p><p>And this man in his old age is beloved of women and children, and the childlike tenderness and simplicity of his nature are revealed in the following incident:</p><p>'In the middle of the room in its white coffin, lay the dead child, the nephew of the poet. Near it in a great chair, sat Walt Whitman surrounded by little ones, and holding a beautiful little girl on his lap. She looked wonderingly at the spectacle of death and then inquiringly into the old man's face. 'You don't know what it is, do you, my dear,' said he, and added, 'we don't either.' </p>
