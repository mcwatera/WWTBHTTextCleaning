<p>WALT WHITMAN'S WORKS, 1876 EDITION.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS. With Portraits and Intercalations 380 pages. $5.</p><p>TWO RIVULETS. Prose and Verse. (Including Memoranda of the War.) Altogether 350 pages. $5.</p><p>Those who have heard that Walt Whitman has become either physically or mentally broken down, or has retired from the contest, or has faltered even for a moment in his plans, will only need to read a very few pages of these volumes, to decide that they have been misinformed. He is here yet, and his style is more daring, more egotistical, more abrupt and involved than ever; he soars more and sings less than ever.</p><p>'Leaves of Grass' remains pretty much in the same shape as of yore. The other volume, 'Two Rivulets,' may be briefly described as a strange alternation of prose and verse, politics and spiritualism. It includes 'Memoranda of the War.'</p><p>But there is nothing in all Walt Whitman's works, new or old, half so marvelous, or half so great a 'curiosity of literature' as the steady persistence of the author amid the nearly unanimous opposition (in this country at least) of orthodox criticism.</p><p>In this connection, among the items we glean from 'interviewers' and others, it is said, we believe authentically, that Whitman has never yet found (and has not to-day) a publisher for his books, but has always printed them himself, and sold them by agents—that they have a little more than paid their own expenses—that there have been six editions or growths—the magazines scornfully refuse his MSS.—that his heart and spirits are just as cheerful as ever—that he has been ill from paralysis and without income or employment for the last three years (during which also his New York agents have shamelessly embezzled the proceeds of his sales, 'which, fortunately,' he dryly remarked to the interviewer, who gives us this item, 'have not been large')—and that he is now poor, though not in want.</p><p>It may interest some to know that the volumes of this 1876 edition, (a very limited one, less than 150 sets in all,) have each the author's physical touch and magnetism. Every book has been handled by him, contains his signature, and the photograph and pictures put in by his own hands. The newer parts were printed at this office.</p><p>Whitman, (P.O. address permanently here in Camden, New Jersey,) sells these books exclusively himself.</p><p>Altogether, as he has come through, and as he holds out to-day, he fully illustrates in himself that</p><p>'Splendid and savage race of old men'</p><p>called for in these pages, in passionate demand for America.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN's MEMORANDA OF THE WAR. Written on the spot, in 1863–65. Author's Publication Camden, New Jersey, 1875–76.</p><p>This is a little book which the Peace Society would do well to circulate at a cheap rate in tens of thousands. During the Union War, a War of Secession as some prefer to call it, Walt Whitman continued steadily through '63, '64, and '65, to visit the sick and wounded of the American armies, both on the field and in the hospitals in and around Washington city. From the first he kept a little note book for impromptu jottings in pencil to refresh his memory of names and circumstances, and what was specially wanted, &c. In these he briefed cases, persons, sights, occurrences in camp, by the roadside, and not seldom by the corpses of the dead. Of the present volume (a presentation copy to a fellow-townsman lies before us), most of its pages are verbatim renderings from such pencillings on the spot. Some were scratched down from narratives he heard and itemized while watching, or writing, or leading somebody amid these scenes. 'Future years,' he says, 'will never know the seething hell and the black infernal background of countless minor scenes and interiors (not the few great battles) of the Secession War. In the mushy influences of current times the fervid atmosphere and typical events of those years are in danger of being totally forgotten. The interior history of the War will not only never be written,—its practicality, minutiae of deeds and persons, will never be suggested. The actual soldier of 1862–65, North and South, with all his ways, his increditable dauntlessness, habits, practices, tastes, language, his appetite, rashness, his superb strength and animality, lawless gait, and a hundred unnamed lights and shades of camp—I say, will never be written—perhaps must not and shall not be.' The present memoranda provides a few stray glimpses into that life, and into those lurid interiors of that period, never to be fully conveyed to the future. It is the hospital part of the drama that is principally here recalled, and of course but a small part of that. The revelation is at once shocking and cheering-shocking, for the man's inhumanity to man, slaves in slavery, tyranny, mutual hate, rebellion, civil war, destructions starting at noonday and at midnight still unsated, horribly obstinate and earnest death struggles, blood, fire, flame, pestilence, wide devastation; cheering, for the glints of manly and womanly virtues under emergencies, or real soldierly heroism in old and young, of patient endurance under hopeless suffering, of customs such as the common routine of life cannot possibly evoke, of disinterested self-sacrifice for the sake of others, of kind offices done under the most unfavourable circumstances. The brief, bare sketches, uncommon and unimproved, as they are, make the book truly one of surpassing human interest,—an interest peculiar to itself, and such as no other book we should read possesses, unless it be the precious record of hospital work or experience of Florence Nightingale at Scutari, but even in that case the details are nothing like so graphic, or given with such significant telling brevity. No poet of any clime—not even Shakespeare, Scott, or Southey—ever depicted the woes of war so powerfully and touchingly as Walt Whitman does, as it were, with a few hurried pencil strokes, in these memoranda. We cannot resist the temptation to quote a few lines. Here is a picture of the camp of the wounded at Chancellorville: 'O heaven, what a scene is this! Is this indeed humanity—these butchers' shambles? There are several of them. There they lie, in the largest, in an open space in the woods, from five to six hundred poor fellows—the groans and screams—the odour of blood, mixed with the fresh scent of the night, the grass, the trees—that slaughter-house!—O well is it their mothers, their sisters cannot see them—cannot conceive, or never conceived, these things . . . . One man is shot by a shell, both in the arm and leg-both are amputated—here lie the rejected members. Some have their legs blown off—some bullets through the breast, some indescribably horrid wounds in the face or head, all mutilated, sickening, torn, gouged out—some in the abdomen—some mere boys—here is one his face enveloped in chalk, lying perfectly still, a bullet has perforated his abdomen—life is ebbing fast, there is no help for him. In the camp of the wounded are many rebels, badly hurt—they take their regular turns with the rest, just the same as any—the surgeons use them just the same . . . . Such is the camp of the wounded—such a fragment, a reflection afar off of the bloody scene—while over all the clear, large moon comes out at times softly, gently shining.' We might fill several columns with what Mr. Whitman calls Glimpses of War's Hell-Scenes, but we prefer closing with a simple scototype regarding two brothers, one South, one North. 'I staid to-night a long time by the bedside of a new patient, a young Baltimorean, aged about 19 years, W.S.P. (2nd Md. Southern), very feeble, right leg amputated, can't sleep hardly at all—has taken a great deal of morphine, which, as usual, is costing more than it comes to. Evidently very intelligent and well-bred—very affectionate—held on to my hand, and put it to his face, unwilling to let me leave. As I was lingering, soothing him in his pain, he says to me suddenly, 'I hardly think you know who I am—I don't wish to impose upon you—I am a rebel soldier.' I said I did not know that, but it made no difference . . . . Visiting him daily for about two weeks after that, while he lived (death had marked him, and he was quite alone) I loved him much, always kissed him, and he did me . . . . In an adjoining ward I found his brother, an officer of rank, a Union soldier, a brave and religious man (Col. Clifton J. Prentiss, Sixth Md. Infantry, ninth corps, wounded in one of his engagements at Petersburg, April 2nd—lingered, suffered much—died in Brooklyn, August 20, 1865). It was in the same battle both were hit. One was a strong Unionist, the other South, both fought on their respective sides, both badly wounded, and both brought together here after an absence of four years. Each died for his cause.'</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN</strong></p><p>A STRANGELY impudent agitation has just been started with regard to what is called 'Walt Whitman's Actual American Position.' Whitman, it may be explained, is an American writer who some years back attracted attention by a volume of so-called poems which were chiefly remarkable for their absurd extravagance and shameless obscenity, and who has since, we are glad to say, been little heard of among decent people. It now appears that, although there is a small coterie of persons in this country who are not ashamed to confess their liking for Whitman's nastiness, his own countrymen have universally repudiated him. 'The real truth,' says an American journal, which has taken up the subject apparently in the interest of Whitman, 'is that, with the exception of a very few readers, Whitman's poems in their public reception have fallen still-born in this country. They have been met, and are met to-day, with the determined denial, disgust, and scorn of orthodox American authors, publishers, and editors, and in a pecuniary and worldly sense have certainly wrecked the life of their author.' 'No established publishing house will publish his books. Most of the stores will not even sell them.' 'Repeated attempts to secure a small income by writing for the magazines during his illness have been utter failures. The Atlantic will not touch him. His offerings to Scribner are returned with insulting notes; the Galaxy the same. Harper's did print a couple of his pieces two years ago, but imperative orders from head-quarters have stopped anything further. All the established American poets studiously ignore Whitman.' We are of course sorry that Whitman, or any other man, should be in sore distress, but we must say that we are very glad indeed to hear that his writings are unsaleable, and that no respectable publisher or editor in America will give him countenance by printing his contributions. This fact, if it is true, shows that the moral sense of the American public is, after all, not quite so much deadened as some recent events might lead one to imagine. If the New York Herald will not have anything to do with Walt Whitman, it is a proof that even the Herald draws the line somewhere. We can only regret that the same view is not taken by all publishers on this side of the ocean, and that there is one firm at least in London which is not ashamed to advertise a 'complete' edition of Whitman's works. We have no desire to pry into details of Whitman's private life. The description which he gives of himself in his writings as 'disorderly, fleshly, sensual,' and fond of loafing, is not perhaps to be taken in a literal sense; and in any case we have no desire to speculate as to how far his private life may have been imprudent or irregular. The important fact is that he has found it impossible to get a living by his writings, which are everywhere shunned and rejected. Considering the character of these writings, this seems to us a very natural and desirable result, and it is difficult to understand why people should be expected to buy an article which disgusts them. Some of Mr. Whitman's friends and admirers in London have, however, worked themselves into a state of theatrical indignation with regard to the treatment of this great man by his unappreciative and ungrateful countrymen. Mr. Robert Buchanan, who has made himself the mouthpiece of this extraordinary agitation, not only claims for Whitman 'literary immortality,' but exalts his 'ineffable goodness' and 'beneficence,' and declares, in a passage flavoured with a touch of blasphemy which we prefer not to quote, that 'only this last consecration of Martyrdom was wanting to complete our poet's apotheosis.' Mr. Buchanan, being himself a poet, naturally chafes against the restraints of ordinary prose, and we are treated to a wonderful picture, in the highest style of fine language, of a 'golden eagle sick to death, worn with age and famine, or with both, passing with weary waft of wing from promontory to promontory, from peak to peak, pursued by a crowd of prosperous rooks and crows, who fall screaming back whenever the noble bird turns his indignant head, and which follow frantically once more, hooting behind him, whenever he ascends their way.' This is all very fine no doubt in its way, but it may be thought to be hardly a fair description of the case of a dirty bird which is shunned on account of its unclean habits. Mr. Buchanan also breaks out into furious vituperation against all American publishers and men of letters, whom he abuses in the most vulgar terms; and warns the American nation collectively that its 'honour will be tarnished eternally by the murder of its only remaining prophet.' Mr. Buchanan concludes by what is really an insulting appeal to his own countrymen, as 'loving and revering' this apostle of beastliness, to give him 'a substantial proof of the honour in which he is held here in the heart of England.'</p><p>From the height of this rhapsodical outburst it is a sad descent to the prosaic facts of the case. It is of course open to any one who admires, or is simply sorry for, Whitman to subscribe for his support; but it is difficult to understand why those who dislike his flagrant indecencies should be denounced because they do not feel inclined to give him any encouragement. Mr. Buchanan himself, though he does not scruple to rank Whitman with the Saviour, and declares that his teaching is 'as heavenly manna,' thinks it necessary to 'disclaim entire sympathy with Whitman's materialistic idealism, which seems to go too far in the direction of illuminating the execrable.' Mr. Buchanan does not explain exactly what he means by 'execrable,' but in any sense such an admission goes far to justify the distrust and loathing with which Whitman is regarded both here and in America. Mr. Buchanan holds that 'these great experiments in poetry' are 'destined to exercise an extraordinary influence on the future of religion as well as poetry,' and this, he says, 'no one who has read his works will deny.' Public opinion, however, both here and in America, has expressed itself very decisively as to these great experiments; and there is very little chance of Mr. Buchanan or any of his associates bringing the world round to a different view. It is no doubt true that there are many people who have never read Whitman's so-called poetry all through, but enough is known to show that it is an attempt to make animal brutality and indecency pass for poetry. No doubt the present effort to revive curiosity on the subject will be a useful advertisement to any bookseller who happens to have a stock of Whitman's garbage on hand. It must be remembered, however, that his earlier works have been before the public for some twenty years, and that during the whole of that time the opinion originally formed of them has been steadily sustained, and, if possible, intensified; and there is, we imagine, very little danger of this judgment being now reversed by friendly puffery and agitation, even when such great authorities as Mr. Buchanan supposes himself to be take up the matter. There are, no doubt, questions both of art and philosophy on which public opinion at times goes astray; but in the present instance the elementary instincts of mankind are sufficient to settle the question. There would indeed need to be a very remarkable change both in the moral and intellectual constitution of educated people before such writings as those of Whitman could be accepted as, in any sense, honest literature.</p><p>When Mr. Buchanan screeches about 'literary outlawry,' 'murder,' 'official persecution,' he is obviously only talking nonsense. We have no desire to say anything in disparagement of American publishers, but they are no doubt not absolutely exempt from the weaknesses of other tradesmen; and we suspect that, if there really were a market anywhere for Whitman's wares, he would have no difficulty in finding some one to retail them for him. It is reasonable to assume that American publishers and editors know their own business, and that they have sufficient reasons for having nothing to do with Mr. Whitman. He has chosen to identify himself with unsavoury things, and whatever he might now write, his name would be a taint to any respectable periodical. The fact is that it was only the indecent exposure which Whitman made of himself in the first instance that attracted passing attention to him as a sort of psychological monstrosity. Apart from his scandalous eccentricities, his writings are poor stuff, and the affectation of deep philosophy is easily seen through. The assumption that a man who sets himself to outrage public decency should be gratefully supported by public charity is certainly a very curious one. Mr. Buchanan asserts that his idol has many worshippers in this country, but we venture to say that this is a part of his delusion; and we may add that those who are so unfortunate in their tastes as to belong to this sect would perhaps act prudently for themselves in not proclaiming it too loudly. The conclusion would seem to be that the 'illumination of the execrable' is not a remunerative business; and so far the lesson is a useful one, and may be taken to heart by any other writers who have a weakness that way. There is also, however, a general principle underlying Mr. Buchanan's letter which deserves notice. He appears to imagine that society is bound, as a matter of course, to contribute to the maintenance of any one who chooses to set up as a man of genius. The genius may be less apparent than some other characteristics, but society is bound all the same to accept implicitly the claimant's own assurance, and that of a few sympathetic friends, that he is a genius, and to provide for him accordingly. This, we fancy, is a favourite idea with a certain class of poets, who have usually reasons of their own for holding that their incomes ought not to be dependent merely on the popularity of their works and the respect in which they are held by those who know them. Instances can no doubt be mentioned of great poets who were not sufficiently appreciated while alive; but, on the other hand, it would be rather hazardous to undertake to provide for every one who, believing himself to be a poet, could not get a living by his works. We should then have a fine flock of hard-up 'golden eagles' eager to take advantage or public charity. If the appeal on behalf of Whitman were based simply on his age and indigence, we should not think ourselves bound to say anything against it. But the plan proposed is to help him circulate his writings, and thus implies approval of them. It is satisfactory to believe that agitation for such a purpose is likely to prove as futile as it is audacious.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S POEMS.</p><p>———</p><p>EXTRACTS FROM 'TWO RIVULETS.'</strong></p><p>Herewith are presented, in advance of their publication, sufficiently copious extracts from Walt Whitman's new volume of poems, 'Two Rivulets,' to give a fair and pretty full summary of it. The book is an intertwining of the author's characteristic verse, alternated throughout with prose; and hence the name. In the Preface he says:</p><p><em>At the eleventh hour, under grave illness, I gather up the pieces of prose and poetry left over since publishing a while since my first and main volume, 'Leaves of Grass'—pieces, here, some new, some old—nearly all of them (somber as many are, making this almost Death's book) composed in by-gone atmospheres of perfect health—and preceded by the freshest collection, the little 'Two Rivulets,' now send them out, embodied in the present Melange, partly as my contribution and outpouring to celebrate, in some sort, the feature of the time, the first Centennial of our New World Nationality—and then as chyle and nutriment to that moral, Indissoluble Union, equally representing All, and the mother of many coming Centennials.</p><p>For some reason—not explainable or definite to my own mind, yet secretly pleasing and satisfactory to it—I have not hesitated to embody in, and run through the volume, two altogether distinct veins or strata—Politics for one, and for the other, the pensive thought of Immortality. The pictures from the hospitals during the war I have also decided to include. Though they differ in character and composition from the rest of my pieces, yet I feel that they ought to go with them, and must do so.</em></p><p>At the outset comes this prelude, or sonata:</p><p>Two Rivulets side by side,<br>Two blended, parallel, strolling tides,<br>Companions, travelers, gossiping as they journey.</p><p>For the Eternal Ocean bound,<br>These ripples, passing surges, streams of Death and Life,<br>Object and Subject, hurrying, whirling by,<br>The Real and Ideal.</p><p>Alternate ebb and flow the Days and Nights,<br>Strands of a Trio twining, Present, Future, Past.</p><p>In You, whoe'er you are, my book perusing,<br>In I myself—in all the World—these ripples flow,<br>All, all, toward the mystic Ocean tending.</p><p>(O yearnful waves! the kisses of your lips!<br>Your breast so broad, with open arms, O firm, expanded shore!)</p><p>And, on a well-known theme this second verse:</p><p>Or, from that Sea of Time,<br>Spray, blown by the wind—a double windrow-drift of<br> weeds and shells.<br>(O little shells, so curious-convolute! so limpid-cold and<br> voiceless!<br>Yet will you not, to the tympans of temples held,<br>Murmurs and echoes still bring up—Eternity's music, <br>faint and far<br>Wafted inland, sent from Atlantica's rim—strains for the <br>Soul of the Prairies.<br>Whisper'd reverberations—chords for the ear of the <br>West, joyously sounding<br>Your tidings old, yet ever new and untranslatable;)<br>Infinitesimals out of my life, and many a life,<br>(For not my life and years alone I give—all, all I give;)<br>These thoughts and Songs—waifs from the deep—here, <br>cast high and dry.<br>Washed on America's shores.</p><p>Then here is what Whitman terms his own poems:</p><p>Currents of starting a Continent new,<br>Overtures sent to the solid out of the liquid,<br>Fusion of ocean and land—tender and pensive waves,<br>(not safe and peaceful only—waves rous'd and ominous<br> too,<br>Out of the depths, the storm's abysms—Who knows <br>whence? Death's waves,<br>Raging over the vast, with many a broken spar and tat-<br>ter'd sail.)</p><p>He says in a concluding part of the preface:</p><p><em>Without being a scientist, I have thoroughly adopted the conclusions of the great savans and experimentalists of our time and of the last hundred years, and they have interiorly tinged the chyle of all my verse for purposes beyond. Following the modern spirit, the real poems of the present, ever solidifying and expanding into the future, must vocalize the vastness and splendor and reality with which scientism has invested man and the universe (all that is called creation), and must henceforth launch humanity into new orbits, consonant with that vastness, splendor, and reality (unknown to the old poems), like new systems of orbs, balanced upon themselves, revolving in limitless space, more subtle than the stars. Poetry, so largely hitherto and even at present wedded to children's tales, and to mere amorousness, upholstery, and superficial rhyme, will have to accept, and, while not denying the past nor the themes of the past, will be revivified by this tremendous innovation, the kosmic spirit, which must henceforth, in my opinion, be the background and underlying impetus, more or less visible, of all first-class songs.</p><p>Only (for me, at any rate, in all my prose and poetry), joyfully accepting modern science, and loyally following it without the slightest hesitation, there remains ever recognized still a higher fact, the eternal soul of man (of all else too), the spiritual, the religious—which it is to be the greatest office of t scientism, in my opinion, and of future poetry also, to free from fables, crudities, and superstitions, and launch forth in renewed faith and scope a hundred fold. To me the worlds of religiousness, of the conception of the Divine, and of the ideal, though mainly latent, are just as absolute in humanity and the universe as the worlds of chemistry or anything in the objective world. To me, the crown of savantism is to be, that it surely opens the way for a more splendid theology, and for ampler and diviner songs. No year, nor even century, will settle this. There is a phase of the real, lurking behind the real, which it is all for. There is also in the intellect of man, in time, far in prospective recesses, a judgment, a last appellate court, which will settle it.</em></p><p><em>EIDÓLONS.</em><br>I met a Seer,<br>Passing the hues and objects of the world,<br>The fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,<br>To glean Eidólons.</p><p>Put in thy chants, said he,<br>No more the puzzling hour, nor day—nor segments, parts,<br>put in,<br>Put first before the rest, as light for all, and entrance-<br>song of all,<br>That of Eidólons.</p><p>Ever the dim beginning;<br>Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle;<br>Ever the summit, and the merge at last, (to surely start<br>again,)<br>Eidólons!

But just for a change I feel like presenting a reflection or two like these:</p><p>1. Of most foreign countries, small or large, from the remotest times known, down to our own, each has contributed after its kind, directly or indirectly, at least one undying song to help vitalize and increase the valor, wisdom, and elegance of humanity, from the points of view attained by it up to date. The stupendous epics of India, the Holy Bible itself, the Homeric canticles, the Nibelungen, the Cid Campeador, the Inferno, Shakespeare's dramas of the passions and of the feudal lords, Burns's songs, Goethe's in Germany, Tennyson's poems in England, Victor Hugo's in France, and many more, are the widely various, yet integral, signs or landmarks (in certain respects the highest set up by the human mind and soul, beyond science, invention, political amelioration, &c.), narrating in subtlest, best ways, the long, long routes of history, and giving identity to the stages arrived at by aggregate humanity, and the conclusions assumed in its progressive and varied civilizations. . . . Where is America's art-rendering, in anything like the spirit worthy of herself and the modern, to these characteristic immortal monuments?</p><p>2. So far, in America, our democratic society (estimating its various strata, in the mass, as one), possesses nothing—nor have we contributed any characteristic music, the finest tie of nationality—to make up for that glowing, blood-throbbing, religious, social, emotional, artistic, indefinable, indescribably beautiful charm and hold which fused the separate parts of the old feudal societies together in their wonderful interpretation, in Europe and Asia, of love, belief and loyalty, running one way like a living weft—and picturesque responsibility, duty and blessedness, running like a warp the other way. (In the Southern States, under slavery, much of the same.) . . In coincidence, and as things now exist in the States, what is more terrible, more alarming than the total want of any such fusion and mutuality of love, belief and rapport of interest, between the comparatively few successful rich and the great masses of the unsuccessful, the poor? . . As a mixed political and social question, is not this full of dark significance? Is it not worth considering as a problem and puzzle in our democracy--an indispensable want to be supplied?</p></em><p>Whitman gives his own portrait from life in the book—a large, bending, gray-haired man, 'looking at you'—and the picture is illustrated by the following verse:</p><p>Out from behind this bending rough-cut Mask,<br>(All straighter, liker Masks rejected—this preferr'd,)<br>This common curtain of the face, contain'd in me for <br>me, in you for you, in each for each,<br>(Tragedies, sorrows, laughter, tears—O heaven!<br>The passionate, teeming plays this curtain hid!)<br>The glaze of God's serenest, purest sky,<br>This film of Satan's seething pit,<br>This heart's geography's map—this limitless small conti-<br>nent—this soundless sea,<br>Out from the convolutions of this globe,<br>This subtler astronomic orb than sun or moon—than <br>Jupiter, Venus, Mars;<br>This condensation of the Universe—(nay, here the only <br>Universe,<br>Here the Idea—all in this mystic handful wrapt;)<br>These burin'd eyes, flashing to you, to pass to future <br>time,<br>To launch and spin through space revolving, sideling— <br>from these to emanate,<br>To You, who'er you are—a Look.</p><p><strong>FREEDOM.</strong></p><p><em>It is not only true that most people entirely misunderstand freedom, but I sometimes think I have not yet met one person who rightly understands it. . . . The whole universe is absolute law. Freedom only opens entire activity and license under the law. To the degraded or undeveloped—and even to too many others—the thought of freedom is a thought of escaping from law—which, of course, is impossible.</p><p>More precious than all worldly riches is Freedom—freedom from the painful constipation and poor narrowness of ecclesiasticism; freedom in manners, habiliments, furniture, from the silliness and tyranny of local fashions—entire freedom from party rings and mere conventions in politics—and, better than all, a general freedom of one's self from the tyrannic domination of vices, habits, appetites, under which nearly every man of us (often the greatest bawler for freedom) is enslaved.</p><p>Can we attain such enfranchisement—the true democracy and the hight of it? While we are from birth to death subjects of irresistible law, inclosing every movement and minute, we yet escape by a paradox, into true free will. Strange as it may seem, we only attain to freedom by a knowledge of, and implicit obedience to law. Great—unspeakably great—is the will! the free soul of man! At its greatest, understand and obeying the laws, it can then, and then only, maintain true liberty . . . . . For there is to the highest, that law as absolute as any—more absolute than any—the law of liberty. The shallow, as intimated, consider liberty a release from all law, from every constraint. The wise seee in it, on the contrary, the potent law of laws, namely, the fusion and combination of the conscious will, or partial individual law, with those universal, eternal, unconscious ones, which run through all time, pervade history, prove immortality, give moral purpose to entire objective world, and the last dignity to human life.</em></p><p><em>TO A LOCOMOTIVE IN WINTER.</em><br>Thee for my recitative!<br>Thee in the driving storm even as now—the snow—the <br>Winter-day declining;<br>Thee in thy panoply, thy measured dual throbbing, and <br>thy beat convulsive;<br>Thy black cylindric body, golden brass and silvery steel;<br>Thy ponderous side-bars, parallel and connecting rods, <br>gyrating, shuttling at thy sides;<br>Thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar—now tapering in the distance;<br>Thy great protruding head-light fix'd in front;<br>Thy long, pale, floating vapor-pennants, tinged with delicate purple;<br>The dense and murky clouds out-belching from thy <br>smoke-stack;<br>Thy knitted frame—thy springs and valves—the tremu-<br>lous twinkle of thy wheels;<br>Thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily-following,<br>Through gale or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily <br>careering;<br>Type of the modern! emblem of motion and power! pulse<br> of the continent!<br>For once, come serve the Muse and merge in verse, even <br>as here I see thee,<br>With storm, and buffeting gusts of wind, and falling <br>snow;<br>By day, thy warning, ringing bell to sound its notes,<br>By night, thy silent signal lamps to swing.</p><p>Fierce-throated beauty!<br>Roll through my chant with all thy lawless music! thy <br>swinging lamps at night;<br>Thy piercing, madly-whistled laughter! thy echoes, rous-<br>ing all!</p><p>Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding;<br>(No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano <br>thine,)<br>Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd,<br>Launch'd o'er the prairies wide—across the lakes,<br>To the free skies, unpent, and glad, and strong.</p><p><strong>NEW POETRY—PROSE GRANDER THAN VERSE.</strong></p><p><em>In my opinion the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry.

Quite a large part of the book is occupied with Whitman's 'Memoranda During the War,' in the army hospitals, or down at the front, being given verbatim from the original notes of the time, 'blotch'd here and there with more than one blood stain, hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom amid the excitement of uncertainty or defeat or of action, or of getting ready for it, or a march.' He says, as he introduces these little note-book mementoes of the war:</p><p><em>Vivid as life they recall and identify the long hospital wards, with their myriad-varied scenes of day or night; the graphic incidents of field or camp; the night before the battle with many solemn yet cool preparations; the changeful exaltations and depressions of those four years, North and South; the convulsive memories (left but a word, a broken sentence serve to recall them); the clews already quite vanished, like some old dream, and yet the list significant enough to soldiers; the scrawled, worn slips of paper that came up by bushels from the Southern prisons, Salisbury or Andersonville, by the hands of exchanged prisoners; the clank of crutches on the pavements or floors of Washington, or up and down the stairs of Paymasters' offices; the grand review of home-bound veterans at the close of the war, cheerily marching day after day by the President's bouse, one brigade succeeding another until it seemed as if they would never end; the strange squads of Southern deserters (escapees, I called them); that little génre group, unrock'd amid the mighty whirl, I remember passing in a hospital corner, of a dying Irish boy, a Catholic priest, and an impoverished altar; four years compressing centuries of native passion, first-class pictures, tempests of life and death, an inexhaustible mine for the histories, drama, romance, and even philosophy of centuries to come; indeed, the vertebra of poetry and art (or personal character too) for all future America (far more grand, in my opinion, to the hands capable of it, than Homer's siege of Tory or the French wars of Shakespeare); and looking over all, in my remembrance, the tall form of President Lincoln, with his face of deep-cut lines, with the large, kind, canny eyes, the complexion of dark brown, and the tinge of weird melancholy saturating all.</p><p>More and more, in my recollections of that period, and through its varied, multitudinous oceans and murky whirls, appear the central resolution and sternness of the bulk or the average American people, animated in soul by a definite purpose, though sweeping and fluid as some great storm—the common people, emblemized in thousands of specimens of first-class heroism, steadily accumulating, (nor regiment, no company, hardly a file of men, North or South, the last three years, without such first-class specimens.)</p><p>I know not how it may have been, or may be, to others—to me the main interest of the war, I found (and still, on recollection, find), in those specimens, and in the ambulance, the hospital, and even the dead on the field. To me, the points illustrating the latent personal character and eligibilities of these States, in the two or three millions of Americans young and middle-aged men, North and South, embodied in armies--and especially the one-third or one-fourth of their number, stricken by wounds or disease at some time in the course of the contest—were of more significance even than the political interests involved.</em></p><p>We also add a few hitherto unpublished forthcoming pieces from 'Leaves of Grass.' On the new title page of that volume appears the following verse, signed by Whitman's autograph:</p><p>Come, said my Soul,<br>Such verses for my Body let us write (for we are one),<br>That should I after death invisibly return,<br>Or, long, long hence, in other spheres,<br>There to some group of mates, the chants resuming<br>(Tallying Earth's soil, trees, winds, tumultuous waves),<br>Ever with pleased smile I may keep on,<br>Ever and ever yet the verses owing—as, first-I here and <br>now,<br>Singing for Soul and Body, set to them my name.</p><p><em>AFTER AN INTERVAL.<br>(Nov. 22, 1875, midnight—Saturn and Mars in conjunction.)</em><br>After an interval, reading, here in the midnight,<br>With the great stars looking on—all the stars of Orion <br>looking,<br>And the silent Pleiades—and the duo looking of Saturn <br>and ruddy Mars;<br>Pondering, reading my own songs, after a long interval <br>(sorrow and death familiar now),<br>Ere closing the book, what pride! what joy! to find them,<br>Standing so well the test of death and night!<br>And the duo of Saturn and Mars!</p><p><em>WHEN THE FULL-GROWN POET CAME.</em><br>When the full-grown poet came,<br>Out spake pleas'd Nature (the round impassive Globe, <br>with all its shows of day and night), saying, He is <br>mine;<br>But out spake too the Soul of Man, proud, jealous and un-<br>reconciled, Nay, he is mine alone;<br>—Then the full-grown Poet stood between the two, and <br>took each by the hand,<br>And to-day and ever so stands, as blender, uniter, tightly <br>holding hands,<br>Which he will never release until he reconciles the two,<br>And wholly and joyously blends them.</p><p><em>THE BEAUTY OF THE SHIP.</em><br>When, staunchly entering port,<br>After long ventures, hauling up, worn and old,<br>Better'd by sea and wind, torn by many a fight,<br>With the original sails all gone, replaced, or mended,<br>I only saw, at last the beauty of the ship.</p><p>The following are extracts from 'Two Rivulets:'</p><p><em>A SONG BY THE POTOMAC.</em><br>By broad Potomac's shore—again, old tongue!<br>(Still uttering—still ejaculating—canst never cease this <br>babble?)<br>Again, old heart so gay—again to you, your sense, the <br>full flush Spring returning;<br>Again the freshness and the odors—again Virginia's Sum-<br>mer sky, peliucid blue and silver<br>Again the forenoon purple of the hills,<br>Again the deathbed grass, so noiseless, soft and green,<br>Again the blood-red roses blooming.</p><p>Perfume this book of mine, O blood-red roses!<br>Lave subtly with your waters every line, Potomac!<br>Give me of you, O Spring, before I close, to put between <br>its pages!<br>O foresoon purple of the hills, before I close, of you!<br>O smiling earth—O Summer sun, give me of you!<br>O deathless grass, of you!</p><p><em>SHIP OF DEMOCRACY.</em><br>Sail—sail thy best, ship of Democracy!<br>Of value is they freight—'tis not the Present only,<br>The past is also stored in thee!<br>Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone—not of <br>thy western continent alone;<br>Earth's resume entire floats on thy keel, O ship—is<br> steadied by thy spars;<br>With thee Time voyages in trust—the antecedent nations <br>sink or swim with thee;<br>With all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, <br>wars, thou bear'st the other continents;<br>Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination-port <br>triumphant;<br>—Steer, steer with good strong band and wary eye, O <br>helmsman—thou carryest great companions,<br>Venerable, priestly Asia sails this day with thee,<br>And royal, feudal Europe sails with thee.</p><p><strong>NEW WORK BY WALT. WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</p><p>NEW YORK, FEB. 23.</p><p>The only American prophet to my knowledge who enjoys a fame in England not accorded him in his own country is the prophet of the new Democratic school of poetry, Walt. Whitman. Although his earlier publications attracted here a certain degree of attention in literary circles, and aroused a great deal of enthusiasm among some of the 'plain people,' whose singer he especially desired to be called, it can hardly be said that his claims to the rank of poet were seriously considered in America until they had been discussed by Mr. W. M. Rosetti [sic], Mr. Robert Buchanan, and other authorities in London. The dubious position which he won here by their help he has not been able to hold. To-day he probably has ten admirers and readers abroad for every one that he has at home. There is a rough honesty, a wild sort of sweetness in the strange man's character, an evident genuineness in his eccentricities, both personal and literary, which have won for him general respect and even a great deal of popular affection, while the estimate of his poetical powers, accepted a few years ago, has been steadily declining. He is no longer one of the curiosities of the Republic; and while the stories of his extreme poverty and suffering which recently obtained circulation are, I am glad to say, untrue, he has fallen into obscurity, if not into positive neglect, and apparently into a mood of sorrow. The impression which one gathers from a few sheets of his forthcoming volume is at any rate rather a melancholy one. He calls the new book 'Two Rivulets,' for it contains a stream of prose and a stream of verse:</p><p>Two Rivulets side by side,<br>Two blended, parallel, strolling tides,<br>Companions, travelers, gossiping as they journey;</p><p>And he sends it out 'partly as my contribution and outpouring to celebrate, in some sort, the feature of the time, the first Centennial of our New World Nationality, and then as chyle and nutriment of that moral and indissoluble union, equally representing all, and the mother of many coming centennials.' Nor is it only in the form of the pieces composing the book that he follows a double line. There are two distinct veins of thought-Politics and Immortality. The rivulets are rude, brawling streams, no doubt, but they keep within much narrower bounds than the turbulent streams of his earlier poems. He has no respect for artificial barriers to poetic inspiration:</p><p><em>In my opinion the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry. I say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character regardless of rhyme, and the measurement-rules of iambic, spondee, dactyl, etc., and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue to furnish the mediums for inferior writers and themes, (especially for persiflage and the comic, as there seems henceforward, to the perfect taste, something inevitably comic in rhyme, merely in itself and anyhow,) the truest and greatest poetry, (while subtly and necessarily always rhythmic, and distinguishable easily enough,) can never again, in the English language, be expressed in arbitrary and rhyming meter, any more than the greatest eloquence, or the truest power and passion. . . .

Altogether 350 pages. $5.</p><p>Those who have heard that Walt Whitman has become either physically or mentally broken down, or has retired from the contest, or has faltered even for a moment in his plans, will only need to read a very few pages of these volumes, to decide that they have been misinformed. He is here yet, and his style is more daring, more egotistical, more abrupt and involved than ever; he soars more and sings less than ever.</p><p>'Leaves of Grass' remains pretty much in the same shape as of yore. The other volume, 'Two Rivulets,' may be briefly described as a strange alternation of prose and verse, politics and spiritualism. It includes 'Memoranda of the War.'</p><p>But there is nothing in all Walt Whitman's works, new or old, half so marvelous, or half so great a 'curiosity of literature' as the steady persistence of the author amid the nearly unanimous opposition (in this country at least) of orthodox criticism.</p><p>In this connection, among the items we glean from 'interviewers' and others, it is said, we believe authentically, that Whitman has never yet found (and has not to-day) a publisher for his books, but has always printed them himself, and sold them by agents—that they have a little more than paid their own expenses—that there have been six editions or growths—the magazines scornfully refuse his MSS.—that his heart and spirits are just as cheerful as ever—that he has been ill from paralysis and without income or employment for the last three years (during which also his New York agents have shamelessly embezzled the proceeds of his sales, 'which, fortunately,' he dryly remarked to the interviewer, who gives us this item, 'have not been large')—and that he is now poor, though not in want.</p><p>It may interest some to know that the volumes of this 1876 edition, (a very limited one, less than 150 sets in all,) have each the author's physical touch and magnetism. Every book has been handled by him, contains his signature, and the photograph and pictures put in by his own hands. The newer parts were printed at this office.</p><p>Whitman, (P.O. address permanently here in Camden, New Jersey,) sells these books exclusively himself.</p><p>Altogether, as he has come through, and as he holds out to-day, he fully illustrates in himself that</p><p><em>'Splendid and savage race of old men'</em></p><p>called for in these pages, in passionate demand for America.</p><p><strong>Walt Whitman, the American Poet.</strong></p><p>———</p><p>Postes nascitur non fit , if true as applied to the individual, ought on the same principle to be true as applied to peoples, and yet, as a matter of fact, there have been but two really great leading nations in poetry—Greece and Great Britain—and this is perhaps the more remarkable, because, beyond the likeness of both being islanders and born with freedom in their souls as an instinct, their general tone of thought and feeling, and modes of expressing them, were, and are, as dissimilar as could well be between two branches of the same distinctive race of men.</p><p>But what is perhaps more remarkable, considering that [an] Anglo-Saxon, when turning colonist, not only takes all his household gods with him into his 'fresh fields and pastures new,' but also his old stereotyped habits and manners, and that therefore, proportionally to the numbers comprised in his 'exodus' to a strange land, would also spring forth in due season poet or poets, as freely in quantity and as great in quality as in the 'old land,' is the fact that the great Anglo-Saxon 'Empire'—in all but name—of the United States has never yet produced one really great poet, although, living as its more energetic sons did, and still do, amidst a newer and far grander variety of wilderness of lake, plain, river, and forest scenery, than their forefathers of the old world did-the natural idea would be that the vastness and freshness of such 'untamed nature' would have even educed a yet loftier strain of song, if possible, than their ancient sires of the past, and their old world brethren of the present sang or sing, and yet, instead of this, their highest and their best are barely above mediocrity, or certainly not more than equal to our second-rate English bards!</p><p>We suppose by their own valuation at least that 'Longfellow' is their best, and yet, when he is at his best, he is not purely American, either in scenery or thoughts, so that their 'national poet' not only lacks the power of expression of his mightier European brethren, but his best writings are also deficient in more 'local colouring,' and so much so that he might almost as well have written most of his works in New South Wales as in New York, as far as mere 'tone' goes, only that in that case our Yankee cousins would not have been able to exclaim, like the great sartorial house of Moses and Sons 'we keep our own poet on the premises!'</p><p>Poietikos, the maker! What a distinctive and expressive name, and yet how few real 'makers' are there in the world—plenty of copyists—plenty of mere rhymsters—plenty of authors (?) [sic] with a 'fatal facility' for that 'easy writing' which, as the wit said, 'was such curst hard reading'—but of the real great ones who can boldly and truthfully say, 'Alone I did it!' How few, how, for the sake of the whole world, lamentably few there be of them, whose heaven-born gift of seeing farther and clearer into the higher spiritual life, around and about us enables them to pierce the mystery and to seize the esoteric meaning of some real truth, and with utterances of genius, translate it into the everyday language of everyday life, and crystallize it as it were, imperishably for all time, to help light up through all the future the lives of the children of men, and show them, as it were, though even as 'in a glass darkly' some faint unearthly radiance reflected from the far off dim seen, lustrous splendours of eternity—some shadowy gleam of</p><p>'The light that never was on land or sea,<br>The poet's inspiration and his dream.'</p><p>Truth said the ancient is but of one face, yet hath many features; and so real poetry differs much in its utterance, flowing 'sweet as the living waters of Pharpar and Abana,' from the one source—mighty and fierce as the thunder falls of Niagara from the other or salt and bitter as the lonely lifeless wave of the Dead Sea of Sodom from a third—and yet all equally 'true,' and doing the work of truth sooner or later, for truth, like wisdom, is 'justified of her children.'</p><p>'Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?' Can a real poet come out of 'dollar land?' Can Brother Jonathan prove that he has really 'raised' a genuine live poet of his own breed and feed, 'clear grit?' and in whose speech speaks unmistakeably the 'voice of many waters,' and in whose breath whispers clearly what the wild winds of the lonely desert, heard in the savage wilds of pathless mountains, and bore secretly and safely through boundless forests, and gave unchanged unto him, to be translated truly from its great mother (nature) tongue, by the mouth of her anointed priest for the teaching of all her children, and for the awakening of new thoughts in the dwellers of older continents and newer colonies.</p><p>Whether America herself believes, or does not believe, that she has such a son in Walt Whitman, his English confreres, or at any rate very many of them, do believe that however she may elect to 'leave him to his fate' with cold indifference as to his present fortunes, and doubt as to his future fame, yet they cordially recognize him as one of the 'deathless band,' and as having not only the right to food here but also to fame hereafter, and as there has been some little controversy about him lately on both sides the Atlantic, and as it is possible that none of his works may have fallen into the hands of some of our readers for them to judge either of his merits or demerits, we subjoin a few extracts as well from his own writings as also from what is said and written about him, both by the American and English Press-by statements in which latter it will be seen that whether he ever gains the distinction in the first line or not, he seems to stand a 'bad' chance of realising the force and suffering from the ill effects of being driven to practise the second in the well-known couplet—</p><p>'Seven Grecian cities claimed great Homer dead,<br>Through which, in vain, he living begged his bread.'</p><p>Let us, however, hope that the moderns will be both more quickly appreciative and actively charitable than the ancients were, and that bread will at least be found him during the remainder of his mortal life, even though fame may not be given to immortalize him after death.</p><p>The apophthegm in physic, 'when doctors differ who shall decide?' is also partly applicable to art and taste, and as everything new must have a beginning, the 'new beginners' in a new faith, or a new interpretation of art, generally meet with rather a 'bad time' of it from the majority whose 'faith' or 'fancy' they seek to change or supplant, and as Walt Whitman is as 'advanced' in some of his ideas about poetry, as Herr Wagner is in his about music, there has been nearly as great a controversy between his few admirers and his many detractors, as to whether his poetry is in any sense poetry at all, and whether it will 'live' or not, as there was, and is, about the Herr's 'music of the future' as being the possible supplanter , in time, of the melody of the present.</p><p>Whether his own countrymen have less 'taste' or more judgment, or whether it is on the principle 'that a prophet is never honoured in his own country,' one thing is certain, that he meets with much more admiration, and, we suppose also, genuine appreciation from the British public and republic of letters, than he does from his own republic, and the citizens thereof, dwellers though they be in the same tents with him, and considering how anxious the Americans are to be thought the equals (at least) of the old world in all matter of a[e]sthetics, as well as superiors in enterprise and general intelligence, it is rather surprising that they do not at once accept the dictum of the literary few in England (whose opinion gives a sort of 'mint stamp') that they really have a swan where they have hitherto seen only a goose, and (like a shrewd trader when he finds a customer sees a value in his goods more than he dreamt of) at once declare that not only is it a veritable swan, but moreover 'a swan amongst swans,' and proclaim at once, loud-tongued to the old world, that what the 'unregenerate' in taste call 'roughness' in him is really unhewn rugged strength, the marble block with the Apollo Belvidere strongly fashioned forth in it, but the smoother chiseling left contemptuously untouched, and the 'obscurity of thought and expression' merely the mannerism of one 'whose faith is large in time,' and who, knowing his work will live, leaves the fuller interpretation of it to the stronger and more advanced minds of the future.</p><p>One of his own countrymen (a press correspondent) thus writes of him—</p><p>The only American prophet to my knowledge who enjoys a fame in England not accorded him in his own country is the prophet of the new Democratic school of poetry, Walt. Whitman. Although his earlier publications attracted here a certain degree of attention in literary circles, and aroused a great deal of enthusiasm among some of the 'plain people,' whose singer he especially desired to be called, it can hardly be said that his claims to the rank of poet were seriously considered in America until they had been discussed by Mr. W. M. Rosetti [sic], Mr. Robert Buchanan, and other authorities in London. The dubious position which he won here by their help he has not been able to hold. To-day he probably has ten admirers and readers abroad for every one that he has at home. There is a rough honesty, a wild sort of sweetness in the strange man's character, an evident genuineness in his eccentricities, both personal and literary, which have won for him general respect and even a great deal of popular affection, while the estimate of his poetical powers, accepted a few years ago, has been steadily declining. He is no longer one of the curiosities of the Republic; and while the stories of his extreme poverty and suffering which recently obtained circulation are, I am glad to say, untrue, he has fallen into obscurity, if not into positive neglect, and apparently into a mood of sorrow. The impression which one gathers from a few sheets of his forthcoming volume is at any rate rather a melancholy one. He calls the new book 'Two Rivulets,' for it contains a stream of prose and a stream of verse:</p><p>Two Rivulets side by side,<br>Two blended, parallel, strolling tides,<br>Companions, travelers, gossiping as they journey;</p><p>and he sends it out 'partly as my contribution and outpouring to celebrate, in some sort, the feature of the time, the first Centennial of our New World Nationality, and then as chyle and nutriment of that moral and indissoluble union, equally representing all, and the mother of many coming centennials.' Nor is it only in the form of the pieces composing the book that he follows a double line. There are two distinct veins of thought-Politics and Immortality. The rivulets are rude, brawling streams, no doubt, but they keep within much narrower bounds than the turbulent streams of his earlier poems. He has no respect for artificial barriers to poetic inspiration:—</p><p><em>'In my opinion the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry. I say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character regardless of rhyme, and the measurement-rules of iambic, spondee, dactyl, etc., and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue to furnish the mediums for inferior writers and themes, (especially for persiflage and the comic, as there seems henceforward, to the perfect taste, something inevitably comic in rhyme, merely in itself and anyhow,) the truest and greatest poetry, (while subtly and necessarily always rhythmic, and distinguishable easily enough,) can never again, in the English language, be expressed in arbitrary and rhyming meter, any more than the greatest eloquence, or the truest power and passion. . . . In my opinion, I say, while admitting that the venerable and heavenly forms of chiming versification have in their time played great and fitting parts, that the pensive complaint, the ballads, wars, amours, legends of Europe, &c., have, many of them, been inimitably rendered in rhyming verse—that there have been very illustrious poets, whose shapes the mantle of such verse has beautifully and appropriately enveloped—and though the mantle has fallen, with perhaps added beauty, on some of our own age—it is, not withstanding, certain to me, that the day of such conventional rhyme is ended. In America, at any rate, and as a medium of highest esthetic practical or spiritual expression, present or future it palpably fails, and must fail to serve. The muse of the prairies, and the peaks of Colorado, dismissing the literary as well as social etiquette of over-sea feudalism and caste, joyfully enlarging, adapting itself to comprehend the size of the whole people, with the free play, emotions, pride, passions, experiences, that belong to them, body and soul—to the general globe, and all its relations in astronomy, as the savans portray them to us—to the modern, the busy nineteenth century, (as grandly poetic as any, only different), with steamships, railroads, factories, electric telegraphs, cylinder presses—to the thought of the solidarity of nations, the brotherhood and sisterhood of the entire earth—to the dignity and heroism of the practical labor of farms, factories, foundries, workshops, mines, or on shipboard, or on lakes and rivers—resumes that other medium of expression, more flexible, more eligible—soars to the freer, vast, diviner heaven of prose.'</em></p><p>There is both force and truth in a good deal of what he then says—for even the poets of all schools admit that rhyme is merely the 'colour to the drawing,' and that blank verse is the experimentum crucis by which to try all real poetry—in fact, as our readers are aware, rhyme only came into use with the early troubadours, who doubtless found that in an age when 'books were not,' and their songs were 'as household words,' that the 'jingle' at the end acted as a sort of mental fishhook, and so enabled them to be more easily remembered. Tho two oldest and grandest poems in the world, perhaps—the sacred one of 'Job,' and the secular one of the 'Iliad,' are in blank verse, or, to speak more correctly, in rhythmical prose, and to rhyme them is not only to ruin them, but is also, more or less, a desecration, even despite Pope's splendid attempt of the one, and because of the miserable 'metrical failures' with the other. Also, Whitman is undoubtedly right in this, that inasmuch as 'the proper study of mankind is man,' so the present should interpret the present, and that there is scope in each age for a great poet to interpret the voice of that special age, and that the 'wonders of steam and telegraphy' have as much claim on us, who have helped their Herculean birth, and are profiting by the labours of their giant man-hood, and have as much right to be 'sung greatly of' by a great singer, as even the mighty men and things of the mighty past, which yet, after all (however 'distance may lend enchantment to the view,' and however grandly they may loom out of the depths of the ancient ages, and seem magnified in the dim mists of antiquity,) were not mightier to the men of their day—nor cannot be really mightier to the men of this—than their own mighty present is, with its boundless material power in its thunder throbs of chained and harnessed lightning, and its spiritual strength in the awakening and widening thrills of higher thought and larger life which pulse profoundly through the great living heart of humanity, with a holier purpose, a stronger will, and a more universal charity than the past ever knew or dreamt of, which even the present yet scarcely foresees the outcome of, and which perchance, the future will fully realise, into the brotherhood of all mankind, and the loving practice of 'peace and goodwill on Earth unto all men!'</p><p.'Yes, my brethren, oh! be hopeful, for the storm precedes <br>the shine,<br>Thro' the clouds of ignorance roll we-on today-dawns more <br>divine.'</p><p>Whitman practises what he preaches by 'singing of steam' in his 'To a Locomotive in Winter,' thus—</p><p>Thee for my recitative!<br>Thee in the driving storm—even as now—the Winter-day <br>declining;<br>Thee in thy panoply, thy measured dual throbbing, and thy<br> beat convulsive;<br>Thy black cylindric body, golden brass and silvery steel;<br>Thy ponderous side-bars, parallel and connecting rods, <br>gyrating, shuttling at thy sides;<br>Thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar—now tapering in <br>the distance;<br>Thy great protruding head-light fix'd in front;<br>Thy long, pale, floating vapor-pennants, tinged with delicate<br> purple;<br>The dense and murky clouds out-belching from thy smoke- <br>stack;<br>Thy knitted frame—thy springs and valves—the tremulous <br>twinkle of thy wheels;<br>Thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily-following,<br>Through gale or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily <br>careering;<br>Type of the modern! emblem of motion and power! pulse of <br>the continent!<br>For once, come serve the Muse and merge in verse, even as <br>here I see thee,<br>With storm, and buffeting gusts of wind, and falling snow;<br>Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding;<br>(No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano thine,)<br>Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd,<br>Launch'd o'er the prairies wide—across the lakes,<br>To the free skies, unpent, and glad, and strong.</p><p>A very characteristic poem of his, though much less 'extravagant,' is</p><p><em>EIDÓLONS.</em><br>I met a Seer,<br>Passing the hues and objects of the world,<br>The fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,<br>To glean Eidólons.</p><p>Put in they chants, said he,<br>No more the puzzling hour, nor day—nor segments, parts,<br>put in,<br>Put first before the rest, as light for all, and entrance- <br>song of all,<br>That of Eidólons.</p><p>Ever the dim beginning;<br>Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle;<br>Ever the summit, and the merge at last, (to surely start<br>again,)<br>Eidólons!

(Camden, 1876.)</p><p>THE new volume by Walt Whitman will not be found to contain any very important illustrations of his theory of poetic composition, or any very original ethical statements, but it throws a good deal of light upon his personal character, and embraces much individual and incidental matter which is of very high interest. In the first place, we fancy that it will be difficult for any sincere critic, desirous of judging without prejudice on either side, to read the 'Memoranda during the War' without acknowledging that the author is personally brave and self-sacrificing, and the preface to the whole without admitting that his aims are pure and his belief in his own mission genuine. It has become difficult to speak of Whitman without passion. His opponents expend upon him every term of obloquy, private and public, which their repertory contains; his more extreme admirers claim for him all the respect reserved, long after their deaths, for the founders of successful religions. Between the class that calls Whitman an immoral charlatan bent on the corruption of youth, and the class that accounts him an inspired prophet, sent, among other iconoclastic missions, to abolish the practice of verse, there lies a great gulf. One would like to ask if it be not permitted that one should hold, provisionally, an intermediate position, and consider him a pure man of excellent intentions, to whom certain primitive truths with regard to human life have presented themselves with great vividness, and who has chosen to present them to us in semi-rhythmic, rhetorical language, which rises occasionally, in fervent moments, to a kind of inarticulate poetry, and falls at others into something very inchoate and formless. A wise admirer might even say that the book called Leaves of Grass was intended to give a section, as it were, of the ordinary daily life of a normal man, and therefore properly falls, as every life does, occasionally into shapeless passages of mere commonplace or worse, Poetry proper being always occupied with the rapid and ecstatic moments of life, whether in sorrow or pleasure. The folly of refusing to admit any beauty in Whitman's work seems obvious in the face of a dozen such passages as the famous 'Burial Hymn,' or the picturesque parts of the rhapsody called 'Walt Whitman;' the danger of acknowledging him with too little reserve is best realised if one conceives the dread possibility of the arising of a school of imitators of his tuneless recitative.</p><p>The book before us contains all the small miscellaneous writings of Whitman now collected for the first time. In verse (or recitative) we have the 'Passage to India,' which appeared in 1872 sic, and 'As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free,' dating from the same year. The prose book called Democratic Vistas was printed in 1871, and all, therefore, which we have to consider here is the opening cluster of rhythmical pieces called 'Two Rivulets,' the 'Centennial Songs,' and the prose 'Memoranda during the War,' all which are now published for the first time. Of the brief but varied contents of the first of these, the most remarkable is a dramatic soliloquy put into the mouth of the dying Columbus, who, sick to death with grief and disappointment, but indomitable still, paces the shores of Jamaica and utters his piteous and majestic lament:—</p><p>'I am too full of woe!<br>Haply I may not live another day;<br>I cannot rest, O God,I cannot eat<br>Or drink or sleep, till I put forth myself,<br>My prayer, once more to Thee,<br>Breathe, bathe myself once more in Thee, commune<br>With Thee, report myself once more with Thee.'</p><p>The division into lines is our own, the sequence of no words being altered, and it will be seen how naturally the slow march falls into scarcely irregular blank verse. This piece, which might take a place among the death-songs of 'A Passage to India' may be contrasted with 'The Ox-Tamer,' a very fine study of life in the West, where</p><p>'In a far-away northern county, in the placid, pas-<br>toral region,<br>Lives my farmer-friend, the theme of my recitative, <br>a famous Tamer of Oxen.'</p><p>This is a worthy pendent to the description of the bridal of the Trapper, and the similar passages of marvellous picturesque directness to be found in Leaves of Grass. An address 'To a Locomotive in Winter' is certainly the most vivid and imaginative view of an apparently hopeless subject yet achieved. 'From that Sea of Time' presents a remarkably beautiful idea of the poet holding to his ear, one after another, the limpid and voiceless shells blown up on the shore of history, and hopelessly striving to gain from their murmurs some tidings of the sea of Time from whence they come, a thought kindred to the famous fancies of Wordsworth and of Landor. There is not much else in the section which possesses special merit, and there is one piece, called 'Eidolons,' which contains almost every vicious habit of style which Whitman has ever adopted, and which is quite enough, alone, to make the general objection to his writings plausible.</p><p>Of the four 'Centennial Songs,' one, 'The Song of the Redwood Tree,' has something primitive or Vedic in the strength of imagination which links in it in one great chorus the vast forces of nature, rain and snow and the wild winds, colossal trees, and huge mountains, and the serene skies above them all. This heroic chant is full of an arrogance appropriate to the occasion, and is far above any perfunctory trickle of complimentary song. The other three rhapsodies are hardly poetic, though vigorous and sympathetic. In the determination 'to sing a song no poet yet has chanted,' Whitman forces into his page an enumeration, of necessity fragmentary and whimsical, of the mechanical inventions and natural products of America. The result is decidedly grotesque. There is a very advanced Swedish poet of our day who has introduced 'petroleum' into his verse, but that was in singing of the French Commune, and even he, and certainly every other bardic person, small or great, would shrink from inditing such a line as:—</p><p>'Steam-power, the great express-lines, gas, petro-<br>leum .'</p><p>The catalogue of the limbs of the human body, which has been so much laughed at in Leaves of Grass, was better than this. To Whitman the world and all it contains is so ceaselessly exciting and delightful that he is willing to let any objects whatever pass before his imagination in a kind of ceaseless phantasmagoria. This, however, is not enough for a poet; he has a constructive and elective work to do. Shelley has described the poet's enjoyment in the mere lazy observation of the current facts of nature, but he has not neglected to observe that this is not in itself poetry, any more than food or even chyle is in itself blood, for he has been careful to add:—</p><p>'Out of these create he can<br>Forms more real than living man.'</p><p>It would be too much to assert that no poet will ever arise great enough to create nurselings of immortality out of the observation of such matters as express-lines, gas or petroleum, but certainly to recapitulate with emphasis the names of these things is not to produce poetry.</p><p>Space is not left us to characterise fully the 'Memoranda during the War.' They are notes, fragments, ejaculations of the most unaffected kind, and do more than any other writing to endear Whitman to us. There is something inexpressibly tender and manly in the tone of these notes; and something exceedingly stirring in the description of the alternate excitement and depression of the war-time: the pleasure in the presence around him of so many brave and handsome men, all fired with the same patriotic exaltation; the sadness of watching the deaths of so many of these in the prime of life. In the true spirit of his own passionate 'Calamus,' he wandered from tent to tent, ministering to the dying, comforting the wounded, bearing everywhere about with him that fragment of fragrant reed, that fascination of personal character, which he values so highly, and which he exercises over many who know him only through his books. From a literary point of view, his prose style may be justly criticised as heavy and disjointed, but the intrinsic interest of the story easily carries the reader above it. In some cases, as in the marvellously powerful description of the scene in the theatre when President Lincoln was shot, he is swept away into real eloquence, as in his recitatives into real poetry, by the fervour of his imagination. The ethical purpose of the book—and it is needless to say that it has one—manifestly is to exemplify in a very tragical passage of real life the possibility of carrying out that principle of sane and self-sacrificing love of comrades for one another which Whitman has so often celebrated in his most elevated and mystical utterances. It is the old story of Achilles and Patroclus transferred from windy Troy to the banks of the Potomac. It is conceivable that when all Whitman's theories about verse and democracy and religion have been rejected or have become effete, this one influence may be still at work, a permanent bequest of widened emotion to all future generations.</p><p>EDMUND W. GOSSE</p><p><strong>SONGS OVERSEA.</strong></p><p><em>Two Rivulets</em> By Walt Whitman. Author's Edition. Camden, New Jersey, U.S.A.</p><p>It is now many years since the peace and placidity of the Republic of Letters, beginning to be shaken a little here at home by new songs of new singers, was first disturbed by the announcement of the advent of a great new poet on the other side of the Atlantic, a poet who, according to the expressions of the little band—small indeed but rapidly waxing—was to answer to the desire of one of Longfellow's prose-characters, and be the Bard of America with a song appropriate to the vastness of the subject. The poet's name was Walt Whitman, and by this magic name his faithful followers conjured until they got people to read these poems they loved so much. Then, indeed, the storm broke on the heads of the devoted adherents. The form of his song was not that to which so many centuries of European civilisation had been accustomed, therefore it was wholly unmusical, discordant, monstrous, horrible, and shapeless. But this was not all. Behind chaos came hell. The giant who broke light-hearted through the meshes of sonnet and sextain and rondel, who would have laughed with hearty Titanic laughter had he but known of them, at the quaint conceits and recipes of good Master George Puttenham for proportion poeticall, in staffe and in measure, and who recked not of lozenge or Tricquet, Pillaster, spire, sphere, or ovall, was discovered daring to speak of the body to a goodly and God-fearing generation, and for this Homeric simplicity was held as one of the company of the Arbiter or the Aretine. But, if many opposed him, many were of his party, and the most opposite and opposed schools of poetry agreed on this one point—admiration of the new master. But whether praised or blamed, Walt Whitman, with Carlyle's Danton, walked his own wild road whither it led him. But it has led him from the Pays de l'amour, and from passion of any sort, as it has led one of our own sweet chief poets, who once sang love and was cried at for singing, into the fierce arena of political struggle. In 'The Two Rivulets' will be found no stream, no little runlet, that has passed through the Eden-garden of the children of Adam, nor are the waters ruffled by any wind-blown echo of Calamus, nor does the amorous animal—man—roll on and trample down the grass-leaves. Walt Whitman's new volume consists of 'Two Rivulets,'</p><p>For the eternal ocean bound<br>These ripples, passing surges, streams of death and life,</p><p>twin channels of poetry and prose; the already familiar 'Democratic Vistas,' 'Centennial Songs,' 'As a Strong Bird on Pinions free,' 'Memoranda during War,' and 'Passage to India.' There is no need to revive here, even in slightest measure, any part of the old quarrel as to the ex-act designation suitable for such of the works of Walt Whitman as their author considers to be fitly baptised as poems. The power of the singer may be seen still vigorous in the poems 'Eidolons' and 'To a Locomotive in Winter;' the latter wonderful in its investiture of the mechanical monster with the parament of poetry and poetic thought, perhaps not wholly to be understood or appreciated except by those who have been in America; who have with it, in the 'driving snow' of 'a winter day declining,' been</p><p>Launched o'er the prairies wide—across the lakes<br>To the free skies, unpent and glad and strong.</p><p>Here, too, in the 'After the Sea-ship,' as in 'The Song of All Seas,' which concludes the series of Centennial Songs, is found evidence of the writer's strong love and feeling for the sea and for its children, the rivers and lakes, which are found at their mightiest on the American continent. And this strong love for the sea he feels for all Nature. Truly Mr. Symonds says of him in 'The Greek Poets,' 'Hopeful and fearless, accepting the world as he finds it, recognising the value of each human impulse, shirking no obligation, self-regulated by a law of perfect health, he, in the midst of a chaotic age, emerges clear and distinct, at one with nature, and therefore Greek.' It was this admiration, this passionate worship of Nature, which led to much denunciation of the worshipper; it is this which still inspires and informs his work. But the present volume is distinctly a political, a historical, or, perhaps more correctly still, a prophetic book, and it deals with and treats of the mighty future of America. Walt Whitman has been often, and with justice, compared to the painter—poet—prophet William Blake; like him he has not, it may be, obtained the recognition due to him; in this at least he suffers more than Blake, that he is better known in the land of the stranger than at home. Americans question his right to be the typical singer of America. Yet Walt Whitman has merits that no American prose-writer or poet ever yet had, with virtues and strength sufficient for claiming laureateship of the great American nation. Nothing in its way could be more splendidly dramatic and grandly descriptive than the account of the assassination of President Lincoln, one of the greatest and noblest of the central figures of modern political evolution. Space will not permit of its complete quotation from the Memoranda of the War, 'these soiled and creas'd little livraisons, each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket, and fasten'd with a pin… blotched here and there with more than one blood stain,' which are amongst the most precious of Whitman's possessions—amongst the most precious of his gifts.</p><p>After relating how it was announced that Lincoln would be at the theatre on the night of April 14, 1865, and describing the contrast of the fearful tragedy about to be performed with the nature of the performance—Our American Cousin—at which Lincoln, who enjoyed theatrical performances, was present, he proceeds:—</p><p>Through the general hum following the stage pause, with the change of positions, etc., came the muffled sound of a pistol shot which not one hundredth part of the audience heard at the time—and yet a moment's hush—somehow, surely a vague startled thrill—and then, through the ornamented, draperied, starr'd and striped space-way of the President's box, a sudden figure, a man, raises himself with hands and feet, stands a moment on the railing, leaps below to the stage (a distance of perhaps fourteen or fifteen feet), falls out of position, catching his boot-heel in the copious drapery (the American flag), falls on one knee, quickly recovers himself, rises as if nothing had happen'd (he really sprains his ankle, but unfelt then), and so the figure, Booth, the murderer, dress'd in plain black broadcloth, bareheaded, with a full head of glossy raven hair, and his eyes like some mad animal flashing with light and resolution, yet with a certain strange calmness, holds aloft in one hand a large knife—walks along not much back from the footlights, turns fully towards the audience his face of statuesque beauty, lit by those basilisk eyes, flashing with desperation, perhaps insanity—launches out in a firm and steady voice the words, Sic semper tyrannis —and then walks with neither slow nor very rapid pace diagonally across to the back of the stage, and disappears…(Had not all this terrible scene—making the mimic ones preposterous—had it not all been rehears'd in blank, by Booth, beforehand?)</p><p>A moment's hush, incredulous—a scream—the cry of murder. Mrs. Lincoln leaning out of the box, with ashy cheeks and lips, with involuntary cry, pointing to the retreating figure, He has killed the President… And still a moment's strange, incredulous suspense—and then the deluge!—then that mixture of horror, noises, uncertainty—the sound, somewhere back, of a horse's hoofs clattering with speed—the people burst through chairs and railings, and break them up—that noise adds to the queerness of the scene—there is inextricable confusion and terror—women faint—quite feeble persons fall and are trampled on—many cries of agony are heard—the broad stage suddenly fills to suffocation with a dense and motley crowd, like some horrible carnival—the audience rush generally upon it, at least the strong men do—the actors and actresses are all there in their play costumes and painted faces, with mortal fright showing through the rouge; some trembling, some in tears—the screams and calls, confused talk—redoubled, trebled—two or three manage to pass up water from the stage to the President's box—others try to clamber up, etc., etc., etc.</p><p>In the midst of all this, the soldiers of the President's Guard, with others, suddenly drawn to the scene, burst in (some two hundred altogether)—they storm the house, through all the tiers, especially the upper ones, inflamed with fury, literally charging the audience with fixed bayonets, muskets and pistols, shouting 'Clear out! clear out! you sons of———.' Such the wild scene, or a suggestion of it rather, inside the play-house that night.</p><p>. . . . . . .</p><p>And in the midst of that night-pandemonium of senseless hate, infuriated soldiers, the audience and the crowd—the stage and all its actors and actresses, its paint-pots, spangles, and gas lights—the life-blood from those veins, the best and sweetest of the land, drips slowly down, and death's ooze already begins its little bubbles on the lips…. Such, hurriedly sketched, were the accompaniments of the death of President Lincoln. So suddenly, and in murder and horrors unsurpassed, he was taken from us. But his death was painless.</p><p>Such descriptive power as this would of right entitle Walt Whitman to place and name among the sons of men; and it is this, and such as this, which make the faults that must undoubtedly be admitted—among others, and perhaps most flagrant, the idle and unnecessary dislike of the poet to 'old romance,' to 'novels, plots, and plays of foreign courts,' and worst of all to 'love-verses sugar'd in rhyme'—seem comparatively unimportant. Could he apply this power to the whole as to this one chapter, Walt Whitman might abandon all other titles for that of America's first historian.</p><p>TWO RIVULETS; including Democratic Vistas, Centennial Songs, and Passage to India. Author's Edition, Camden, New Jersey, 1876.</p><p>This is a book which thousands will read with intense interest, and tens of thousands throw down in sheer disgust. The former will be such persons as can look beneath the surface, and discern true worth under the most uncouth garb; the latter those who are content to follow the fashion, and take their opinions of poets and philosophers, as they do of bodily costume, from others. Walt Whitman's poetry is like no other that ever was written—boldly conceived, bluntly expressed, purely American yet cosmopolitan—not in the least conventional—uncramped by regular metre—disdaining to be scanned by conceited pedagogues—semi-savage yet most humane—Cyclopean in form and effect. In the book before us, his peculiar powers are exhibited in all their innate force, and the prose part is quite as original and interesting as the poetical part. There is a strange fascination about the whole, to such as are susceptible of feelings unstamped with the seal and signature of admitted authority. All others will, as we have said, declare the writer a bore, but for that there is no help. The deficiency is in them, not in him.</p>
