<p>[ . . .] Others there are deserving of mention, but we must now turn to the volume of the year, which should be specially precious to the American people,—that of the poet who has most firmly grasped the 'American Idea' in its deepest and broadest bearings on humanity. We mean Walt Whitman's 'Good-bye my Fancy.' Here is only a handful of poems, but among them there are jewels which may 'flash their laugh at time.' Other poets may smooth and polish, but there is no other poet in America at present, nor ever has been, who can stir every fibre of one's soul as Whitman can in a few short lines. We fly from peak to peak, unnoting of valleys which may lie in between. The same master's touch, which seems to us specially fine in the little volume called 'Drum Taps,' is evident in these last few songs of his old age. We have space to quote only one,—the last, which, when men have lost their rhythmical prejudices, will hold its own with 'Crossing the Bar,' or the epilogue to 'Asolando':</p><p>Good-bye my Fancy!<br>Farewell dear mate, dear love!<br>I'm going away, I know not where,<br>Or to what fortune, or whether I may ever see you again,<br>So good-bye my Fancy.</p><p>Now for my last—let me look back a moment;<br>The slower fainter ticking of the clock is in me,<br>Exit, nightfall, and soon the heart-thud stopping.</p><p>Long have we lived, joy'd, caress'd together;<br>Delightful!—now separation—Good-bye my Fancy.</p><p>Yet let me not be too hasty,<br>Long indeed have we lived, slept, filter'd, become really blended into one;<br>Then if we die we die together (yes, we'll remain one),<br>If we go anywhere, we'll go together to meet what happens,<br>May-be we'll be better off and blither, and learn something,<br>May-be it is yourself now really ushering me to the true songs, (who knows?)<br>May-be it is you the mortal knot really undoing, turning—so, now, finally,<br>Good-bye—and hail! my Fancy.</p><p><em>C.</em></p><p><strong><em>WHITMAN'S FAREWELL.</em></strong></p><p><strong>———</strong></p><p><strong>A MELANCHOLY BOOK.</strong></p><p><strong>———</strong></p><p><em>GOOD-BYE, MY FANCY. An Annex to Leaves of Grass By Walt Whitman. 8vo, pp. 66. Philadelphia: David McKay.</em></p><p>A dreadful photograph resembling nothing so much as a death-mask serves as grim frontispiece to this ultimate publication by Walt Whitman. According to the practice of his later years the volume is written partly in prose and partly in Walt Whitman's peculiar idea of poetry. There is a melancholy flavor about the whole of it, though the old man tries very hard to be cheerful. More than once, however, he refers to the world's refusal to recognize him as a poet. All the great magazines, he declares, have declined to print his lucubrations, and apparently the general public have not fatigued his publisher with orders for his books. The so-called poetry in this volume is naturally of a valedictory character to a considerable extent, and though it is not less prosaic and unmelodious than the writer's earlier productions, the circumstances under which it was written impart a certain suggestion of pathos to it. Walt Whitman does not indeed face the Unknown with apprehensions and misgivings. If he does not appear to cherish Christian hopes and expectations, his Pantheism has not prevented him from maintaining a belief in another existence, and an existence not less adapted to and filled with activity and energy than the present one. Yet he does not speculate much upon the future. Rather does he seem to be chiefly interested in forecasting the ultimate destiny of 'Leaves of Grass,' which he does not like to think will be relegated to the limbo of unused or unreadable books.</p><p>This question is of course not one upon which those who like or who dislike Walt Whitman's writings can pass final judgment. Posterity often does surprising things and adopts queer views. Among its peculiarities is a tendency 'parcere subjectis et debellare superbos' to spare the conquered and vanquish the proud; and for all any one living knows this proclivity may be exercised on behalf of Walt Whitman. As regards his contemporaries, they certainly have not discovered in him the music of the future, and the reasons which have determined the prevailing judgment upon him do not appear weak or capricious. Walt Whitman himself retains a consolatory assurance of his own position, and it is not worth while to attempt to disturb his faith. In the concluding pages of the present volume he gives some autobiographic memoranda which will be found interesting and quaintly illustrative of character. As for the more pretentious papers—attempts at essay-writing and the like—perhaps the less said about them the better. For it is unfortunately the fact that when Walt Whitman tries to be profound he commonly becomes unintelligible, seeming to lose his footing in a bag of verbiage. His passion for stringing words together in catalogue-form recalls old Burton at times, though of course Whitman has nothing of Burton's erudition. Let us hope, however, that his last booklet may contribute somewhat to the comfort of his age and the assuagement of his infirmities.</p><p><strong>QUEEN NATHALIE.—WALT WHITMAN.—THE YOUNG EMPEROR.</strong></p><p>Several books of considerable interest have been published this month, but there is no one book which towers above the rest far enough to justify special attention being paid to its contents. There are, however, three or four which may be mentioned among the most interesting of the new publications of the month.</p><p>The first is the thinly veiled story of the grievances of Queen Nathalie, which is published by Ollendorf, of Paris, under the title 'Le Roi Stanko et la Reine Xenia.' The wrongs of the unhappy Queen Nathalie are set forth in this volume with sympathizing pen. The identity of the various personages described in this chronique scandaleuse are easily recognizable. Queen Nathalie herself has retired into private life, while her own son has paid his first official visit to St. Petersburg. The contrast between the demonstrations of welcome which have been accorded the child, and the cold indifference with which his royal mother has been received in the country which gave her birth, is one of the unpleasant incidents in the development of the Eastern drama.</p><p>A very different book is the latest collection of the poems of Walt Whitman, entitled 'Good-bye, My Fancy,' a second annex to 'The Leaves of Grass,' published by David McKay, of Philadelphia. The book is published as a memorial of war times. The volume contains some of the articles which Walt Whitman has contributed to periodical literature of late years. We extract only one short poem with its characteristic foot-note:</p><p><strong>FOR QUEEN VICTORIA'S BIRTHDAY</strong></p><p>An American arbutus bunch to be put in a little vase on the royal breakfast-table, May 24, 1890:—</p><br><p>Lady, accept a birthday thought—haply an idle gift and <br>token<br>Right from the scented soil's May-utterance here<br>(Smelling of countless blessings, prayers, and old-time <br>thanks)—<br>A bunch of white and pink arbutus, silent, spicy, shy,<br>From Hudson's, Delaware's, or Potomac's woody banks.</p><p><em>Note.</em>—'Very little as we Americans stand this day, with our sixty-five or seventy millions of population, an immense surplus in the treasury, and all that actual power or reserve power (land and sea) so dear to nations, very little, I say do we realize that curious, crawling national shudder when the 'Trent Affair' promised to bring upon us a war with Great Britain, followed unquestionably, as that war would have been, the recognition of the Southern Confederacy by all the leading European nations. It is now certain that all this train of inevitable calamity hung on arrogant and peremptory phrases in the prepared and written missives of the British Minister to America, which the Queen (and Prince Albert latent) positively and promptly cancelled; and that her firm attitude did alone erase and leave out against all the other official prestige and Court of St. James. On such minor and personal incidents (so to call them) often depend the great growths and turns of civilization. This moment of a woman and queen surely swung the grandest oscillation of modern history's pendulum. Many sayings and doings of that period, from foreign potentates and powers, might well be dropped in oblivion by America—but never that if I could have my way.'</p><p>Of the English books, that which bears most closely upon current affairs is Harold Frederic's volume on the German Emperor. Mr. Harold Frederic is a thoroughly competent journalist. As the London correspondent of the New York Times he has distinguished himself as almost the only competent letter-writer from the Old World to the New. What Mr. G. W. Smalley was in his prime, some years ago, and more than, that Mr. Harold Frederic is now. He sometimes has a curious squint which prevents his seeing straight; but for good, all-round work, great industry, and capacity for saying what he has to say in clear, interesting English, Mr. Harold Frederic is the best of English correspondents. His book on 'The Young Emperor' is thoroughly characteristic. It is clear, bright, well up to date and thoroughly 'on the nail.' But it bears also some of his characteristic blemishes. Mr. Frederic repeats as true the story that the Emperor Frederick had drawn up and signed his abdication, a statement which is stoutly denied by all those who ought to know, and there are other statements relating to the period of the Emperor Frederick's illness which have given considerable pain to those most concerned.</p><p>Still, after all deductions are made, it is a good and readable book, which appears just in the nick of time, and contains material enabling us to form a conception of the character of one of the most remarkable of modern rulers. It is to be regretted, however, that Mr. Frederic did not complete his book, firstly, by some careful chronological table of the acts and deeds of the young Emperor; secondly, that he did not give us an index; thirdly, that he did not reprint a verbatim translation of the Emperor's speech on education. Possibly he may do all these things in his second edition.</p><p><strong>The Second Annex to 'Leaves of Grass.'*</strong></p><p>In one way Walt Whitman may be said to be very unlike his poet-compeers, ancient or modern—in his inability in any sort to efface, in prose or poem, his own personality. It is all a part of him. His life is in it all: 'tis what he is, thinking, seeing, hearing, feeling—more outwardly than inwardly, perhaps. He has no characters; is never dramatic. He is always on the march—</p><p>'I tramp a perpetual journey;'—</p><p>going somewhere—seeing somewhat, hailing, greeting, saluting—reverencing, too, in the good sense of the term. One may not care for this or that so-called poem—think it no poem, for that matter; but take his book, with its accumulating 'annexes,' for all in all, and you cannot well get away from it, are glad to have it around, lying near handy; and are more apt than otherwise to light on a line, or many lines, that go to the spot, as he himself might say, and yield full satisfaction. In reading Emerson's verse to others, I have at times found a disturbance from the thought and beauty of it all (with a secret wish that I had not begun to read and a vow that I would never do the like again), by my auditor's smile or half sneer at the author's sometimes forced rhymes or prosy lines; as though that were the point, and mattered at all. To hear a poem only with the outer ear is not to hear it at all—nine times in ten. And the tenth time, more than likely, there is no poem to hear. Reading Whitman aloud is even more difficult. Not for the faulty rhyme—for the absence of any intention of that sort eliminates that difficulty—but for the same inability of average mortals to detect beneath the strange in form, or the supposed want of proper poetic form, the breathing of a poet-spirit. Lowell voices in the best way it can be voiced this limitation, or to my mind wrong poetic notion, in his 'Fable for Critics:'</p><p>'Then comes Emerson first, whose rich words, every one,<br>Are like gold nails in temples to hang trophies on;<br>Whose prose is grand verse, while his verse, the Lord knows,<br>Is some of it pr——No, 'tis not even prose.'</p><p>The critic could hear the poem underneath Emerson's prose, because</p><p>'Aye climb for his rhyme,'</p><p>closes the finer ear to the revelation.</p><p>'In the worst of his poems are mines of rich matter.<br>But thrown in a heap with a crash and a clatter.'</p><p>And beyond, amid, or underneath the 'crash' and the 'clatter' there is no vibratory soul-music. And yet—</p><p>'Now, it is not one thing nor another alone<br>Makes a poem, but rather the general tone,<br>The something pervading, uniting the whole,<br>The before unconceived, unconceivable soul.'</p><p>When the critic in the next line intimates that this 'something pervading, uniting the whole' may be lost 'just in moving this trifle or that,' and so you</p><p>'Take away, as it were, a chief limb of the statue.'</p><p>he is intent on the perfection of the artificer or builder, so seeking the poem's life, loses it. Lost to him because of faulty form; but for another, willing the 'unconceivable soul' should build its own form, not dictatory, not outwardly measuring, there may abide all the force and beauty of a spiritual or poetical vision; the glimpsing of that which, after all, for the most part, lies beyond the ken of sight, or power of words or painter's brush to report,—'the unconceived, unconceivable soul.' Poetry is ever suggestion; never 'a twice-told tale of God.' There is Lowell's 'Foot-Path.'</p><p>'It mounts athwart the windy hill<br>Through shallow slopes of upland bare,<br>And fancy climbs with footfall still<br>Its narrowing curves that end in air.'</p><p>What lies beyond?</p><p>'What Nature for her poets hides,<br>'Tis wiser to divine than clutch.'</p><p>The 'prying, peeping critic' here takes to his heels; the poet comes joyously forward, and modestly:</p><p>'The bird I list hath never come<br>Within the scope of mortal ear;<br>My prying step would make him dumb,<br>And the fair tree, his shelter, sear.</p><p>'Behind the hill, behind the sky,<br>Behind my inmost thought, he sings;<br>No feet avail; to hear it nigh,<br>The song itself must lend the wings.'</p><p>∗∗∗∗∗</p><p>I know not, and will never pry,<br>But trust our human heart for all;<br>Wonders that from the seeker fly<br>Into an open sense may fall.</p><p>The culture, the skill, the art, that close this 'open sense,' turns the poet blind from his vision.</p><p>Art lies in knowing how little is needed. A new vista, and the work is done. This is the 'open secret' in all true civilizing—to get rid of the superfluous and be not only content but well supplied with little. Neither too much, nor too much finish. Whitman speaks of 'the last polish and intellectual 'cuteness of Emerson,' but just whether to like it or not, I don't make out. To my reading the 'polish' and the ''cuteness' both go to rendering best things in smallest compass. In this respect Whitman does not himself, certainly, err. He owns up for himself: 'I have probably not been enough afraid of careless touches from the first—and am not now—nor of parrot-like repetitions, nor platitudes and commonplace.' And yet, perhaps again, he would have spent it all or very much of it had he faltered for such 'intellectual ''cuteness' or to give a 'last polish.' One may with profit to himself do considerable editing, abbreviating or omitting altogether phrases and lines. But solely, as I think, it is their redundancy that is disturbing—this however, in his longer poems, wherein one at times loses himself in nothing special or tires of too much 'cataloguing.' Whitman says, 'Perhaps I am too democratic for such avoidances.' (Of this much talk of the 'democratic' there may be something to say another time. Just now to say that it sometimes reminds me of my Sunday-school teacher's encomium of the universal, democratic, paternal idea of 'the good God, who knows and has numbered every hair on your head, even the hairs of your eyebrows, and each drop of blood in your entire system.' But it always seemed to me there was no small 'waste of powder' in such exactitude: as though a few hairs more or less, or drops of blood, much mattered—to the soul of me!)</p><p>To leave preface just at the end and come to the book—most welcome is this 'Second Annex.' No, you had 'not better withhold.' There is no 'old age' nor 'paralysis' here that tires, or makes me sorrow that you have kept and given forth these</p><p>'Last droplets of and after spontaneous rain.'</p><p>'This little cluster' brings fragrant memories and old-age excellencies—'from sane, completed, vital, capable old age.' Well, I agree (and it please me)—'The final proof of song or personality [and I have but stumbled on this now after penning the above] is a sort of matured, accreted, superb, evoluted, almost divine, impalpable diffuseness and atmosphere or invisible magnetism, dissolving and embracing all—and not any special achievement of passion, pride, metrical form, epigram, plot, thought, or what is called beauty.' You have done well to 'improve to-day's opportunity;' but do not 'wind up'—till you do wind up. All these last little chants, songs, greetings, come with especial flavor of friendliness, as do all the bits of reminiscence. Especially have I enjoyed 'Old Actors, Singers, Shows, etc.'—you say in 'New York;' but I had my hearing of most of those you mention elsewhere. The sad thing of it all is the 'sooner or later inevitably wending to the flies or exit-door—vanishing to sight and ear—and never materializing on this earth's stage again!' Why things cannot stay and be and remain on and on, when once they come—that is the question. And the answer is, 'Perhaps, most likely, they do—and will, forever!'</p><p>The two poems that always appear to my mental view when I think of or turn Leaves of Grass are: 'The Song of the Open Road' and 'The Mystic Trumpeter.' That they are so much different from or superior to others in the same volume, I do not presume to say; but they for some reason have fixed themselves in among my likings, and I turn the leaves sometimes with a sort of half fearing they may have some way escaped their rootings, and are no longer there. I am sorry the book is not now before me, that I may refresh myself with lines that it would also be here a pleasure to quote. But here at hand is 'When the Full-Grown Poet Came'—a short poem, but one that holds philosophy for all—poet or non-poet—if such there be—equally concerned with the same reconciliation and harmony. I will read it again for myself and write it out as I read:</p><p>'When the full-grown poet came,<br>Out spake pleased Nature (the round, impassive globe, with all its shows of<br> day and night),<br>Saying, He is mine;<br>But out spake, too, the Soul of man, proud, jealous and unreconciled, Nay,<br> he is mine alone;<br>—Then the full-grown poet stood between the two, and took each by the <br>hand;<br>And to-day and ever so stands, as blender, uniter, tightly holding hands,<br>Which he shall never release until he reconciles the two,<br>And wholly and joyously blends them.'</p><p><em>Sidney Morse.</em></p><p>———</p><p>∗ 'Good-Bye, my Fancy!' Walt Whitman. 1891.</p><p>WHITMAN, WALT. Good-bye, my fancy: 2d annex to 'Leaves of grass.' D. McKay. por. 8º, $1.</p><p>'Walt Whitman still lives. One more utterance from our old original individualistic American poet, now, as he tells us, in his seventy-second year, and not expecting to write any more; this, indeed, written as it were in defiance of augury. The grand old fellow in that little of new he gives us is in good fettle and equal to himself. Most of the volume is made up of recollections, memories not only of facts, but of thoughts, and they are not the least interesting, especially his recollections of persons once famous, but long since gathered in by the reaper. The following is mystical, indeed everything that Whitman has written is mystical, a shadowing forth of a half comprehended entity in thought:</p><p><em>'LONG, LONG HENCE.</em><br>'After a long, long course, hundreds of years, denials,<br>Accumulations, rous'd love and joy and thought,<br>Hopes, wishes, aspirations, ponderings, victories, myr-<br>iads of readers<br>Coating, compassing, covering—after ages' and ages' <br>encrustations,<br>Then only may these songs reach fruition.'</p><p>—Commercial Advertiser.</p><p><strong>'Good-Bye, my Fancy!'*</strong></p><p>THE GREEKS put in their graves an image of Hermes the psychopompos to convey the spirit over into the land of shades. 'Good-bye, my Fancy!' is Walt Whitman's Hermes-image to convey his parting salutations to the afterworld. In its sixty-six pages we have a medley and motley of prose and verse like what the countryman calls the rich 'strippings' of the cow's milk, the last and oiliest, the most nutritious and creamiest of the lacteal fountain. A few things here have been published before. The Critic's readers have tasted and enjoyed the uncloying 'Old Man's Rejoinder,' 'For Queen Victoria's Birthday,' 'The Pallid Wreath' and 'Unassail'd Renown'; but the bulk of the book—its stem, stalk and flower—is new to the public and has not before tempted the intellectual palate.</p><p>I sing of life, yet mind me still of Death,</p><p>is the keynote of the volume, in which the author humorously calls himself a sea-shell cast up by the sea. Yet does he not remember the wonderful susurrus of that Wordsworthian shell which, though far inland, whispered of its native place even as that susurrus in the soul whispered of immortality? The almost dead shell of the 'greybeard sufi' has a live soul in it capable still of radiant abalone-like iridescences. The chemist's tincture brings out these wondrous tints even as opportunity will elicit them from the 'conch' of Camden.</p><p>In fact, here I am these current years 1890 and '91 (each successive fortnight getting stiffer and stuck deeper), much like some hard-cased dilapidated grim ancient shell-fish or time-bang'd conch (no legs, utterly non-locomotive) cast up high and dry on the shore-sands, helpless to move anywhere—nothing left but to behave myself quiet, and while away the days yet assign'd, and discover if there is anything for the said grim and time-bang'd conch to be got at last out of inherited good spirits and primal buoyant centre-pulses down there deep somewhere within his gray-blurr'd old shell***And old as I am I feel to-day almost a part of some frolicsome wave.</p><p>The 'shell' is indeed a part of the 'frolicsome wave' which laves it into exquisite curves and colors. This is Whitman's universal quality, his sympathy, his world-wide hand-clasp, his general salutation to the universe. The shell and the sea are comrades, and so is every creeping and smiling or sailing and winged creature—comrades all in that catholic-apostolic camaraderie which includes every sprout and germ of the divine energy—a camaraderie as close and as kind as that which clasped hamadryad and enclosing oak together. Death, which inspires so many of these beautiful irregular lines, looms up magical and benign before a mind simply wondering, not abashed—the 'eidόlon-yacht' of his soul ready to put forth on its mirage-haunted seas with utmost trustfulness. Whitman's beliefs come out singularly strong and triumphant here and there among the creed-leaves of the book: beliefs in future personality, identity, immortality, a merciful and loving God, progress, consciousness: he peoples that dim world with these, and it becomes immediately lustrous. These brave beliefs ring almost gayly through 'An Ended Day,' 'The Pallid Wreath,' 'My 71st Year,' 'Shakespeare-Bacon's Cipher,' and other protests against materialism, often as beautifully expressed as Tennyson's or Whittier's vital faith. Indeed, the whole book is a book of 'last words' from dying lips sealing a life that has been blameless. There is no sound of lamentation or Job-cry in it, pervaded as it is with bright, broad optimism, the grace of benignant utterance, the egoism of a healthy and gracious child. Almost the only querulous note is the plaintive reference to rejected MSS. sent in to the 'great magazines.' The generous recognition of Tennyson and Ruskin and the other English and American admirers has offset this, and kept the paralyzed author from real want. The last twenty pages or so are full of Pascal-like pensées  grouped in paragraphs, vividly poetic, many of them, with Whitmanesque threads and colorations running all through. Such are 'A Death-Banquet,' 'Some Laggards Yet,' 'Splinters,' 'Health,' 'Crossing from Jersey City,' 'An Engineer's Obituary' (his brother), and the 'Old-Age Jottings.' Histrionic New York of thirty or forty years ago reappears delightfully in 'Old Actors, Singers, Shows, etc.'—a tell-tale bead of personal recollections in which the author suspends a votive offering before each vanished image and lingering voice, all quaintly carved in his own rich involved English. Much ruddy philosophy courses through these recollections—healthy love of the drama, love of a beautiful voice, love of Shakespeare and the great artists—of Alboni and Jenny Lind and Fanny Kemble and fine reading.</p><p>The author turns the kodak on himself and reveals each inner sanctuary of his moral and physical nature. Now in his seventy-third year, he is as fresh and piquant as ever, as devoted to his great 'America,' his ideal Democracy, his poetic theories as he was in 1855, when he began jotting down his revolutionary memoranda. And at the forefront of it all looks out a portrait—profile rounded like the arch of the full moon, nebulous, Ossianlike, but striking in its filmy vagueness.</p><p>———</p><p>∗ Good-Bye, my Fancy! Second Annex to Leaves of Grass By Walt Whitman. [deletion, illegible] Philadelphia: David McKay.</p><p><em>Good By My Fancy. 2d Annex to Leaves of Grass</em> By Walt Whitman. (Philadelphia: David McKay.).</p><p>Of Walt Whitman we could say nothing unkind—we could speak with sincere and sympathetic respect. His latest book does not challenge criticism; it is evidently the work of a mind sorely diseased, worn out indeed. The fragmentary, disjointed essay entitled 'An Old Man's Rejoinder,' is suggestive of unmitigated pathos. There is just enough in it to show how deeply Walt Whitman has suffered because he has not been able to convince competent critics of his ability as a poet, and there is enough there as well to make one sympathize with the old poet, no matter how much one may feel the justice of what the critics have done. There is nothing of any value whatever in this book. One reads parts of it with a twinge of curiosity tempered with sadness. So far as what purports to be literature is concerned here is the end of a wasted life. 'I have been and am rejected by all the great magazines,' he says, and the saying suggests untold pangs of defeat. That the great magazines were right and Walt Whitmon sic wrong the contents of this thin, crazy-quilt volume amply prove without the trouble of calling upon 'Leaves of Grass' for more convincing testimony. We wish Walt Whitman every good that life can bring; but it will be well for the world when his writings disappear and are as little talked of as they always have been little read.</p><p><strong>GOOD-BYE MY FANCY.*</strong></p><p>THERE is something at once very pathetic and courageous in this definitive leave-taking by the poet Walt Whitman. His traits and his place in literature need no farther discussion at present; neither does his absorbent personality that has desired to assimilate the world, or the singular contests of praise and blame which have been waged about him. Such as he is—and surely he is unique -he now bids farewell, and yet not farewell, to his gift of utterance:</p><p>On, on the same, ye jocund twain!<br>My life and recitative . . .<br>. . .I and my recitatives, with faith and love<br>Waiting to other work, to unknown songs, conditions,<br>On, on, ye jocund twain! continue on the same!</p><p>And again:</p><p>Good-bye my Fancy,<br>Farewell dear mate, dear love!<br>I'm going away, I know not where<br>Or to what fortune, or whether I may ever see you again,<br>So Good-bye my Fancy . . . .</p><p>If we go anywhere we'll go together to meet what happens,<br>Maybe we'll be better off and blither, and learn something,<br>May-be it is yourself now really ushering me to the true <br>songs (who knows?)<br>May-be it is you the mortal knot really undoing, turning— <br>so now finally<br>Good-bye—and hail, my Fancy.</p><p>Other poems in this small but characteristic collection continue the design of the author's previous work, completing the message 'today at twilight. . .with vital voice, reporting yet'—the brave veteran! More than half the volume is made up of prose articles and fragments. In these Mr. Whitman's manner remains much the same as in his chants, while the reader is at least spared the continual negation of the laws of the technical art of poetry. In an essay on 'National Literature' he finds the essential traits of the American people to be good-nature, decorum, and intelligence, and bases his hopes upon these qualities. In music, despite the critics who assure him he belongs to the worship of Wagner, he dwelt under 'the old Italian dispensation,' as he calls it, and wishes that he might thank the composer Verdi for 'much noble pleasure and happiness.' The somber velvet of the voice of Signora Alboni1 also charmed him; and the brave songs of the Hutchinsons, with their sister, 'the red-cheeked New England carnation, sweet Abby.'2 Kean in King John, and Fanny Kemble in Fazio, 'a rapid-running, yet heavy-timber'd, tremendous, wrenching, passionate play,' and the comedy of Hackett,3 appealed, in their day, to Mr. Whitman; and were followed in his theatrical enjoyments by a long list of other artists. He describes his habitation, 'a rather large 20 by 20 low-ceiling'd room something like a big old ship's cabin,' in literary disorder of papers and books, with its three windows, the stove and oak-wood fuel, and the great arm-chair spread with a 'wide wolf-skin of hairy black and silver.'</p><p>If this volume shall be, as the author appears to intend, his last literary effort, it closes firmly and fitly the literary career of a poet who has with pride and fidelity obeyed his own genius, and who has sought to collect within himself, and to understand and speak—in his oracular, strange voice—the experiences of common humanity.</p><p>∗ Good-Bye My Fancy By Walt Whitman D. McKay. $1.00.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S GOOD-BYE.</strong><p>'Why do folks dwell so fondly on the last words, advice, appearance, of the departing? Those last words are not samples of the best, which involve vitality at its full, and balance, and perfect control and scope. But they are valuable beyond measure to confirm and endorse the varied train, facts, theories, and faith of the whole preceding life.' So says Walt Whitman in a foot-note to the little volume which he has just put forth ('Good-bye, my Fancy.' 2d. Annex to 'Leaves of Grass.' Philadelphia: David McKay). We may hope that the aged poet will still be with us for many a long day, but this collection of scraps of all kinds—verses, essays, thoughts, speeches, recollections—have something of the interest of last words. Here is his poetical good bye:—</p><p>Good-bye my Fancy!<br>Farewell dear mate, dear love!<br>I'm going away, I know not where,<br>Or to what fortune, or whether I may ever see you again,<br>So good-bye my Fancy! . . . .<br>Yet let me not be too hasty,<br>Long indeed have we lived, slept, filter'd, become really blended into one;<br>Then if we die we die together, (yes, we'll remain one,)<br>If we go anywhere we'll go together to meet what happens,<br>May-be we'll be better off and blither, and learn something,<br>May-be it is yourself now really ushering me to the true songs (who knows?)<br>May-be it is you the mortal knob really undoing, turning—so now finally<br>Good-bye—and hail! my Fancy.</p><p>In another poem—'A Twilight Song'—Whitman celebrates the unknown heroes of the War:—</p><p>A special verse for you—a flash of duty long neglected—your mystic roll strangely gather'd here,<br>Each name recall'd by me from out the darkness and death's ashes,<br>Henceforth to be, deep, deep within my heart recording, for many a future year,<br>Your mystic roll entire of unknown names, or North or South,<br>Embalm'd with love in this twilight song.</p><p>In some 'last saved items' the poet gives us some of his characteristic ideas in prose:—</p><p>In its highest aspect, and striking its grandest average, essential Poetry expresses and goes along with essential Religion. . . . The philosophy of Greece taught normality and the beauty of life. Christianity teaches how to endure illness and death. I have wonder'd whether a third philosophy fusing both, and doing full justice to both, might not be outlined. . . . It will not be enough to say that no Nation ever achiev'd materialistic, political, and money-making successes, with general physical comfort, as fully as the United States of America are to-day achieving them. I know very well that those are the indispensable foundations—the sine qua non of moral and heroic (poetic) fruitions to come. For if those pre-successes were all—if they ended at that—if nothing more were yielded than so far appears—a gross materialistic prosperity only—America, tried by subtlest tests, were a failure—has not advanced humanity a bit further than other nations. . . . Essentially my own printed records, all my volumes, are doubtless but offhand utterances from Personality, spontaneous, following implicitly the inscrutable command, dominated by that Personality, vaguely even if decidedly, and with little or nothing of plan, art, erudition, &c. If I have chosen to hold the reins, the mastery, it has mainly been to give the way, the power, the road, to the invisible steeds. (I wanted to see how a Person of America, the last half of the nineteenth century, would appear, put quite freely and fairly in honest type.)</p><p>Turning now to personalia, we may give a few of Walt Whitman's 'old age jottings.' He describes how he was seriously ill and paralyzed after the war, and had his books printed during a lingering convalescence 'to occupy the tediousness of glum days and nights.' The sale of the volumes abroad was very satisfactory. 'The price was 10 dol. a set. Both the cash and the emotional cheer were deep medicines; many paid double or treble price. (Tennyson and Ruskin did).' Among other subscribers, he mentions the two Rossettis, W. B. Scott, E. W. Gosse, Spence Watson, G. H. Lewes, G. H. Boughton, M. D. Conway, and Hubert Herkomer. This opportune English encouragement plucked him, he says, like a brand from the burning: 'and if ever I have a biographer I charge him to put it in the narrative. I have had the noblest friends and backers in America; and yet perhaps the tenderest and gratefullest breath of my heart has gone, and ever goes, over the sea-gales across the big pond.'</p><p>Of his life in general he gives the following summary:—</p><p>I have pass'd an active life, as country school-teacher, gardener, printer, carpenter, author, and journalist, domiciled in nearly all the United States and principal cities, North and South—went to the front (moving about and occupied as army nurse and missionary) during the Secession War, 1861 to '65, and in the Virginia hospitals and after the battles of that time, tending the Northern and Southern wounded alike—work'd down South and in Washington city arduously three years—contracted the paralysis which I have suffer'd ever since—and now live in a little cottage of my own, near the Delaware in New Jersey. My chief book, unrhym'd and unmetrical (it has taken thirty years, peace and war, 'a borning'), has its aim, as once said, 'to utter the same old human critier—but now in Democratic American modern and scientific conditions.' Then I have publish'd two prose works 'Specimen Days,' and a late one 'November Boughs.'</p><p>Of 'the little cottage' he gives the following picture:—</p><p>In the upper of a little wooden house of two stories near the Delaware river, earth shore, sixty miles up from the sea, is a rather large 20-by-20 low ceiling'd room something like a big old ship's cabin. The floor, three quarters of it with an ingrain carpet, is half cover'd by a deep litter of books, papers, magazines, thrown-down letters and circulars, rejected manuscripts, memoranda, bits of light or strong twine, a bundle to be 'express'd,' and two or three venerable scrap books. In the room stand two large tables (one of ancient St. Domingo mahogany with immense leaves) cover'd by a jumble of more papers, a varied and copious array of writing materials, several glass and china vessels or jars, some with cologne water, other with real honey, granulated sugar, a large bunch of beautiful fresh yellow chrysanthemums, some letters and envelopt papers ready for the post office, many photographs, and a hundred indescribable things besides. There are all around many books, some quite handsome editions, some half cover'd by dust, some within reach, evidently used (good-sized print, no type less than long primer), some maps, the Bible (the strong, cheap edition of the English crown), Homer, Shakespere, Walter Scott, Emerson, Ticknor's 'Spanish Literature,' John Carlyle's Dante, Felton's Greece, George Sand's Consuelo, a very choice little Epictetus, some novels, the latest foreign and American monthlies, quarterlies, and so on. There being quite a strew of printer's proofs, and slips, and the daily papers, the place with its quaint old-fashioned calmness has also a smack of something alert and of current work. There are several trunks and depositories back'd up at the walls; (one well-bound and big box came by express lately from Washington city, after storage there for nearly twenty years). Indeed the whole room is a sort of result and storage collection of my own past life. I have here various editions of my own writings, and sell them upon request; one is a big volume of complete poems and prose, 1000 pages, autograph, essays, speeches, portraits from life, &c. Another is a little Leaves of Grass, latest date, six portraits, morocco bound, in pocket-book form.</p><p>Fortunately the apartment is quite roomy. There are three windows in front. At one side is the stove, with a cheerful fire of oak wood, near by a good supply of fresh sticks, whose faint aroma is plain. On another side is the bed with white coverlid and woollen blankets. Toward the windows is a huge arm-chair (a Christmas present from Thomas Donaldson's young daughter and son,) Philadelphia timber'd as by some stout ship's spars, yellow polish'd, ample, with rattan-woven seat and back, and over the latter a great wide wolf skin of hairy black and silver, spread to guard against cold and draught. A time-worn look and scent of old oak attach both to the chair and the person occupying it.</p><p>May the heart of oak within him long continue to beat!</p>
