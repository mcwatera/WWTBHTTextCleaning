<p>AN American Rough, whose name is WALT WHITMAN, and who calls himself a 'Kosmos,' has been publishing a mad book under the title of Leaves of Grass. We can only say that these Leaves of Grass are fully worthy to be put on a level with that heap of rubbish called Fern Leaves, by FANNY FERN, and similarly 'green stuff.' The fields of American literature want weeding dreadfully.</p><p>Carlyle represents a contemporary reviewer taking leave of the Belles-Lettres department somewhat in this abrupt manner:</p><p>The end having come, it is fit that we end—Poetry having ceased to be read, or published, or written, how can it continue to be reviewed? With your Lake Schools, and Border-Thief Schools, and Cockney and Satanic Schools, there has been enough to do; and now, all these Schools having been burnt or smouldered themselves out, and left nothing but a wide-spread wreck of ashes, dust, and cinders—or perhaps dying embers, kicked to and fro under the feet of innumerable women and children in the magazines, and at best blown here and there into transient sputters, what remains but to adjust ourselves to circumstances? Urge me not, [continues this desperate litterateur] with considerations that Poetry, as the inward Voice of Life, must be perennial; only dead in one form to become alive in another; that this still abundant deluge of Metre, seeing there must needs be fractions of Poetry floating, scattered in it, ought still to be net-fished; at all events, surveyed and taken note of. The survey of English metre, at this epoch, perhaps transcends the human faculties; to hire out the reading of it by estimate, at a remunerative rate per page, would, in a few quarters, reduce the cash-box of any extant review to the verge of insolvency.</p><p>Such is the humorous but essentially truthful picture of the condition and product of the creative faculties during the second quarter of the present century. The great poets, Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth, Goethe, and Schiller, had fulfilled their tasks and gone to other spheres; and all that remained with few exceptions, were weak and feeble echoes of their dying strains, caught up and repeated by numerous imitators and pretenders. And so has it ever been; the visions and perceptions of one man become the creed and superficial life-element of other minds. Swedenborg1 is worthy to be enrolled among the master minds of the world, because he entered for himself into the Arcana of the profoundest mysteries that can concern human intelligences; his greatest thoughts are revolved, quoted and represented in all 'New Church' publications, but very rarely digested and assimilated by those who claim to be his followers. Still more rare is it to find any receiver of 'the heavenly doctrines' determined to enter for himself into the very interiors of all that Swedenborg taught—to see, to the mighty reflections that Swedenborg was able to give of interior realities, but their originals as they stand constellated in the heavens!</p><p>But Divine Providence, leading forth the race, as a father the tottering steps of his children, causes the outward form, on which all men are prone to rely, to be forever changing and passing away before their eyes. The seeds of death are ever found luring in the fairest external appearances, till those externals become the mere correspondences and representatives of interior realities, and then, though enduring as the fadeless garments of the blest, they are ever-varying, as those robes of light change with each changing state. The Coming Age will recognize the profoundest truths in the internal thought of the Swedish sage, while his most tenacious adherents will be forced to admit that, in externals, he often erred, and was not unfrequently deceived. But the discovered error will not only wean them from a blind and bigoted reliance upon frail man, but confirm the sincere lovers of truth in loyalty to her standard. So also, the spiritualists are being taught a severe but salutary lesson, that if they will penetrate into the heavenly Arcana of the Inner Life, they must do so by purifying and elevating their own minds, and not by 'sitting in circles' or ransacking town and country to find the most 'reliable Mediums.' Still no step in human progress and development is in vain; even the falls of the child are essential to his discipline. The mistakes and errors of men are needful while in their present imperfect state. They are to the seekers of truth what trials and losses are to those in the pursuit of wealth; they but enhance the value of the prize, and confirm the devotion of the true aspirant as frowns rekindle the ardor of lovers.</p><p>Moreover, as man must ever enter into the kingdom of a new unfolding truth with the simplicity and teachableness of little children, it is well that the outer form of the old disappear, that the new may stand alone in its place. It seems also to be a Law that when a change entire and universal is to be outwrought, the means preparatory to its introduction shall be equally widespread, and ultimated to the lowest possible plane. Hence the Spiritual manifestations meet the most external minds; and allow even the unregenerate to know by experience the fact and process of Spiritual inspiration; so that scepticism becomes impossible to the candid and living mind. The second step will be, after such have been convinced that Spiritual intercourse is possible, that they learn that it is worse than useless for the purpose of attaining anything desirable, beyond this conviction—except so far as is orderly and directed, not by the will of man, but of God. But as the old form of poetic inspiration died out with Byron and Shelley, Wordsworth and Goethe, and the miscellaneous Spirit-intercourse itself also as quickly passes away, there will, we apprehend, spring up forms of mediatorial inspiration, of which there will be two permanent types. The first and highest, as it seems to us, will be the opening of the interiors to direct influx to the inspiring sources of love and wisdom. The heavens will flow down into the hearts and lives, into the thought and speech of harmonic natures, as the silent dews impregnate the patient earth. Men will live in heaven, hence they must be inspired by that breath of life that fills its ethereal expanse. A second class of Media will be used for the ultimation, for ends of use and in accordance with Laws of Order, of the creative thoughts and hymns, the Epics and Lyrics, of individual Spirits and societies of Spirits. These will be to the former Media as the youthful artist who copies the work of a master, to the Angelos and Raphaels, who both design and execute their plans, though they themselves, in their deepest interiors, are instructed and sustained from above.</p><p>But in the transition period in which we now are, many varieties of Mediumship must be expected. There are those who stand in rapport with the diseased mentalities of the past and present and pour forth as Divine Revelations the froth and scum of a receding age; they are the sponges who absorb the waste and impurities of humanity. They are also like running sores that gather the corrupt humors and drain the body of its most noxious fluids. There are others who come in contact with the outmost portion of the Spirit-life. These give crude, and in themselves, false notions of the state of man after death; yet they prepare the way for more truthful disclosures; if in no other way by stimulating the appetite for more substantial nourishment. There are those who are lifted by genial inspirations to receive influxes from the upper mind-sphere of the age. They stand, as it were, on clear mountains of intellectual elevation, and with keenest perception discern the purer forms of new unfolding truths ere they become sufficiently embodied to be manifest to the grosser minds of the race. Of these Ralph Waldo Emerson is the highest-type. He sees the future of truths as our Spirit-seers discern the future of man; he welcomes those impalpable forms, as Spiritualists receive with gladdened minds the returning hosts of Spirit-friends.</p><p>There are other mediatorial natures who are in mental and heart-sympathy with man, as he now is, struggling to free himself from the tyranny of the old and effete, and to grasp and retain the new life flowing down from the heavens. And as the kindling rays at first produce more smoke than fire, so their lay is one of promise rather than performance. Such we conceive to be the interior condition of the author of Leaves of Grass. He accepts man as he is as to his whole nature, and all men as his own brothers. The lambent flame of his genius encircles the world—nor does he clearly discern between that which is to be preserved, and that which is but as fuel for the purification of the ore from its dross. There is a wild strength, a Spartan simplicity about the man, and he stalks among the dapper gentlemen of this generation, like a drunken Hercules amid the dainty dancers. That his song is highly mediatorial he himself asserts, though probably he is unacquainted with the Spiritual developments of the age.</p><p>Through me [he sings] many long dumb voices,<br>Voices of the interminable generations of slaves,<br>Voices of the diseased and despairing.<br>Voices of the cycles of preparation and accretion,<br>And of threads that connect the stars,<br>And of the rights of them the others are down upon.<br>Through me forbidden voices—voices veiled,<br>Voices indecent, by me clarified and transfigured.</p><p>We omit much even in this short extract, for the book abounds in passages that cannot be quoted in drawing-rooms, and expressions that fall upon the tympanums of ears polite, with a terrible dissonance. His very gait, as he walks through the world, makes dainty people nervous; and conservatives regard him a social revolution. His style is everywhere graphic and strong, and he sings many things before untouched in prose or rhyme in an idiom that is neither prose nor rhyme, nor yet orthodox blank verse. But it serves his purpose well. He wears strange garb, cut and made by himself, as gracefully as a South American cavalier his poncho. We will continue our quotations.</p><p>Such are the graphic pictures which this new world-painter flings from his easel and dashes upon the moving panorama of life. His night-thoughts are not less striking, as borne by the Muse, he looks into every chamber, and hears the quiet breathing of slumbering humanity.</p><p>As the volume advances towards its conclusion, the Spirit of the poet becomes calmer and more serenely elevated. But everywhere his sympathy is with man, and not with conventionalisms.</p><p>We cannot take leave of this remarkable volume without advising our friends who are not too delicately nerved, to study the work as a sign of the times, written as we perceive, under powerful influxes; a prophecy and promise of much that awaits all who are entering with us into the opening doors of a new era. A portion of that thought which broods over the American nation, is here seized and bodied forth by a son of the people, rudely, wildly, and with some perversions, yet strongly and genuinely, according to the perception of this bold writer. He is the young Hercules who has seized the serpents that would make him and us their prey; but instead of strangling, he would change them to winged and beautiful forms, who shall become the servants of mankind.</p><p>THE ASSEMBLY OF EXTREMES.—A subtle old proverb says, 'extremes meet,' and science, Art, and even morality, sometimes testify to the truth of the proverb; and there are some curious problems involved in the demonstration of it. The loftiest attainment of the wisdom and worth of age only reaches to the simplicity and fervor of childhood, from which we all start, and returning to which we are blessed. Art makes the same voyage round its sphere, holding ever westward its way into new and unexplored regions, until it does what Columbus would have done, had his faith and self-denial been greater, reaches the east again. If the individual, Columbus, failed to accomplish the destiny, the class, Columbus, fails never. And so in Art, what no one does, the many accomplish, and finally the cycle is filled.</p><p>We see this most forcibly in the comparison of two late poems, as unlike, at first thought, as two could be, and yet in which the most striking likenesses prevail, 'MAUD,' and 'LEAVES OF GRASS;'† the one as refined in its Art as the most refined, delicate in its structure, and consummate in its subtlety of expression, the other rude and rough, and heedless in its forms—nonchalant in everything but its essential ideas. The one comes from the last stage of cultivation of the Old World, and shows evidence of morbid, luxurious waste of power, and contempt of mental wealth, from inability longer to appreciate the propriety of subjects on which to expend it; as, to one who has overlived, all values are the same, because nothing, and indifferent; while the other, from among the 'roughs,' is morbid from overgrowth, and likewise prodigal of its thought-treasure, because it has so much that it can afford to throw it away on everything, and considers all things that are, as equally worth gilding. The subject of MAUD is nothing—a mere common-place incident, but artistically dealt with—a blanched, decayed sea-shell, around which the amber has gathered; and that of the newer poem is equally nothing, blades of sea-grass amber-cemented. Both are characterized by the extreme of affectation of suggestiveness—piers of thought being given, over which the reader must throw his own arches. Both are bold, defiant of laws which attempt to regulate forms, and of those which should regulate essences. Maud is irreligious through mental disease, produced by excess of sentimental action—'Leaves of Grass', through irregularly-developed mental action and insufficiency of sentiment. A calmer perception of Nature would have corrected in Tennyson that feeling which looks upon sorrow as the only thing poetic, and serenity and holy trust, as things to which Love has no alliance, while a higher seeing of Nature would have shown Walt Whitman that all things in Nature are not alike beautiful, or to be loved and honored by song.</p><p>Although it is mainly with the Art of the two poems that we have to deal, the form rather than the motive, yet so entirely does the former arise from the latter that the criticism passed on the one must lie upon the other. In the mere versification,for instance, of both, see what indifference to the dignity of verse (while there is still the extorted homage to its forms), arising in both cases, it would seem, from an overweening confidence in the value of what is said, as in the following passages:</p><p>'Long have I sighed for a calm; God grant I may find it at last!It will never be broken by Maud, she has neither savor nor salt,But a cold, clear, cut face, as I found when her carriage past,Perfectly beautiful: let it be granted her: where is the fault?'</p><p>Maud, Sec. ii., St. 1.</p><p>'Do you suspect death? If I were to suspect death, I should die now.<br>Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward<br>annihilation?<br>Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,<br>Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good.<br>The whole universe indicates that it is good.<br>The past and present indicates that it is good.'</p><p>Leaves of Grass, p. 69.</p><p>All Tennyson's exquisite care over his lines produces no other impression than that which Whitman's carelessness arrives at; viz., nonchalance with regard to forms. In either case, it is an imperfection, we are bold to say, since we do not love beauty and perfection of form for nothing, nor can the measure of poetic feeling be full when we do not care for the highest grace and symmetry of construction. It is an impertinence which says to us, 'my ideas are so fine that they need no dressing up,' even greater than that which says, 'mine are so fine that they cannot be dressed as well as they deserve.' The childlike instinct demands perfect melody as an essential to perfect poetry, and more than that, the melodious thought will work out its just and adequate form by the essential law of its spiritual organization—when the heart sings, the feet will move to its music. An unjust measure in verse is prima facie evidence of a jarring note in the soul of the poem, and studied or permitted irregularity of form proves an arrogant self-estimation or irreverence in the poet; and both these poems are irreverent, irreligious, in fact. Maud commences, singularly enough, with the words, 'I hate,' and the whole sentiment of the poem ignores the nobler and purer feelings of humanity—it is full of hatred and morbid feeling, diseased from pure worldliness. This is well enough for one whom the world calls a laureate, but the true poet seeks a laurel that the world cannot gather, growing on mountains where its feet never tread, he lives with beauty and things holy, or, if evil things come to him, it is that they may be commanded behind him. 'Maud' rambles and raves through human love and human hate, and the hero lives his life of selfish desire and selfish enjoyment, and then through the bitterness of selfish regret and despair, without one thought of anything better, nobler than himself—the summit of creation. He worships nothing, even reverences nothing, his love is only passion, and his only thought of God one of fear. In his happiness, he is a cynic, in his unhappiness, a madman.</p><p>For the drift of the Maker is dark, an Isis hid by the<br>veil.<br>Who knows the ways of the world, how God will bring<br>them about?<br>Our planet is one, the suns are many, the world is wide.<br>Shall I weep if a Poland fail? shall I shriek if a Hun-<br>gary fail?<br>Or an infant civilization be ruled with rod or with<br>nout?<br>I have not made the world, and He that made it will<br>guide.<br>Be mine a philosopher's life in the quiet woodland<br>ways,<br>Where if I cannot be gay let a passionless peace be my<br>lot,<br>Far off from the clamor of liars belied in the hubbub<br>of lies;<br>From the long-neck'd geese of the world that are ever<br>hissing dispraise<br>Because their natures are little, and, whether he heed<br>it or not,<br>Where each man walks with his head in a cloud of<br>poisonous flies.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>Dead, long dead,<br>Long dead!<br>And my heart is a handful of dust,<br>And the wheels go over my head,<br>And my bones are shaken with pain,<br>For into a shallow grave they are thrust,<br>Only a yard beneath the street,<br>And the hoofs of the horses beat, beat,<br>The hoofs of the horses beat,<br>Beat into my scalp and my brain,<br>With never an end to the stream of passing feet,<br>Driving, hurrying, marrying, burying,<br>Clamor and rumble, and ringing and clatter,<br>And here beneath it is all as bad,<br>For I thought the dead had peace, but it is not so;<br>To have no peace in the grave, is that not sad?<br>But up and down and to and fro,<br>Ever about me the dead men go;<br>And then to hear a dead man chatter<br>Is enough to drive one mad.<br>Wretchedest age, since Time began,<br>They cannot even bury a man;<br>And tho' we paid our tithes in the days that are<br>gone,<br>Not a bell was rung, not a prayer was read;<br>It is that which makes us loud in the world of the<br>dead;<br>There is none that does his work, not one;<br>A touch of their office might have sufficed,<br>But the churchmen fain would kill their church,<br>As the churches have kill'd their Christ.<br>See, there is one of us sobbing,<br>No limit to his distress;<br>And another, a lord of all things, praying<br>To his own great self, as I guess;<br>And another, a statesman there, betraying<br>His party-secret, fool, to the press;<br>And yonder a vile physician, blabbing<br>The case of his patient—all for what?<br>To tickle the maggot born in an empty head,<br>And wheedle a world that loves him not,<br>For it is but a world of the dead.</p><p>'Leaves of Grass' is irreligious, because it springs from a low recognition of the nature of Deity, not, perhaps, so in intent, but really so in its result. To Whitman, all things are alike good—no thing is better than another, and thence there is no ideal, no aspiration, no progress to things better. It is not enough that all things are good, all things are equally good, and, therefore, there is no order in creation; no better, no worse—but all is a democratic level from which can come no symmetry, in which there is no head, no subordination, no system, and, of course, no result. With a wonderful vigor of thought and intensity of perception, a power, indeed, not often found, 'Leaves of Grass' has no ideality, no concentration, no purpose—it is barbarous, undisciplined, like the poetry of a half-civilized people, and, as a whole, useless, save to those miners of thought who prefer the metal in its unworked state. The preface of the book contains an inestimable wealth of this unworked ore—it is a creed of the material, not denying the ideal, but ignorant of it.</p><p>'The greatest poet hardly knows pettiness or triviality. If he breathes into anything that was before thought small, it dilates with the grandeur and life of the universe. He is a seer…he is individual…he is complete in himself…the others are as good as he, only he sees it and they do not. He is not one of the chorus…he does not stop for any regulation: he is the president of regulation. What the eyesight does to the rest he does to the rest. Who knows the curious mystery of the eyesight? The other senses corroborate themselves, but this is removed from any proof but its own, and foreruns the identities of the spiritual world. A single glance of it mocks all the investigations of man, and all the instruments and books of the earth, and all reasoning. What is marvellous? what is unlikely? what is impossible, or baseless, or vague? after you have once just opened the space of a peachpit, and given audience to far and near, and to the sunset, and had all things enter with electric swiftness, softly and duly, without confusion, or jostling, or jam.</p><p>'The land and sea, the animals, fishes, and birds, the sky of heaven and the orbs, the forests, mountains, and rivers, are not small themes…but folks expect of the poet to indicate more than the beauty and dignity which always attach to dumb, real objects…they expect him to indicate the path between reality and their souls. Men and women perceive the beauty well enough…probably as well as he. The passionate tenacity of hunters, woodmen, early risers, cultivators of gardens, and orchards, and fields, the love of healthy women for the manly form, sea-faring persons, drivers of horses, the passion for light and the open air, all is an old varied sign of the unfailing perception of beauty, and of a residence of the poetic in out-door people. They can never be assisted by poets to perceive…some may, but they never can. The poetic quality is not marshalled in rhyme, or uniformity, or abstract addresses to things, nor in melancholy complaints or good precepts, but is the life of these and much else, and is in the soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme, and of uniformity, that it conveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme and uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of metrical laws, and bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs or roses on a bush, and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts, and oranges, and melons, and pears, and shed the perfume impalpable to form. The fluency and ornaments of the finest poems, or music, or orations, or recitations, are not independent, but dependent. All beauty comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. If the greatnesses are in conjunction in a man or woman it is enough…the fact will prevail through the universe…but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will not prevail. Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost.</p><p>*****</p><p>'The greatest poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art, I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writing any elegance, or effect, or originality, to hang in the way between me and the rest like curtains. I will have nothing hang in the way, not the richest curtains. What I tell I tell for precisely what it is. Let who may exalt, or startle, or fascinate, or sooth, I will have purposes as health, or heat, or snow, has, and be as regardless of observation.

But still they are the extremes—truth lies between them always. What if Columbus had sailed round the world, and made its extremes meet! He would only have been back in Spain again—the true end of his voyage was midway.</p><p>Leaves of Grass Brooklyn. 1855.</p><p>EVERYTHING about the external arrangement of this book was odd and out of the way. The author printed it himself, and it seems to have been left to the winds of heaven to publish it. So it happened that we had not discovered it before our last number, although we believe the sheets had then passed the press. It bears no publisher's name, and, if the reader goes to a bookstore for it, he may expect to be told at first, as we were, that there is no such book, and has not been. Nevertheless, there is such a book, and it is well worth going twice to the bookstore to buy it. Walter Whitman, an American,—one of the roughs,—no sentimentalist,—no stander above men and women, or apart from them,—no more modest than immodest,—has tried to write down here, in a sort of prose poetry, a good deal of what he has seen, felt, and guessed at in a pilgrimage of some thirty-five years. He has a horror of conventional language of any kind. His theory of expression is, that, 'to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of the movements of animals, is the flawless triumph of art.' Now a great many men have said this before. But generally it is the introduction to something more artistic than ever,—more conventional and strained. Antony began by saying he was no orator, but none the less did an oration follow. In this book, however, the prophecy is fairly fulfilled in the accomplishment. 'What I experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition. You shall stand by my side and look in the mirror with me.'</p><p>So truly accomplished is this promise,—which anywhere else would be a flourish of trumpets,—that this thin quarto deserves its name. That is to say, one reads and enjoys the freshness, simplicity, and reality of what he reads, just as the tired man, lying on the hill-side in summer, enjoys the leaves of grass around him,—enjoys the shadow,—enjoys the flecks of sunshine,—not for what they 'suggest to him,' but for what they are.</p><p>So completely does the author's remarkable power rest in his simplicity, that the preface to the book—which does not even have large letters at the beginning of the lines, as the rest has—is perhaps the very best thing in it. We find more to the point in the following analysis of the 'genius of the United States,' than we have found in many more pretentious studies of it.</p><p>'Other states indicate themselves in their deputies, but the genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors;—but always most in the common people. Their manners, speech, dress, riendships;—the freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the picturesque looseness of their carriage, their deathless attachment to freedom, their aversion to everything indecorous or soft or mean, the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of one State by the citizens of all other States, the fierceness of their roused resentment, their curiosity and welcome of novelty, their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy, their susceptibility to a slight, the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors, the fluency of their speech, their delight in music (the sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance of soul), their good temper and open-handedness, the terrible significance of their elections, the President's taking off his hat to them, not they to him,—these too are unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of it.'</p><p>The book is divided into a dozen or more sections, and in each one of these some thread of connection may be traced, now with ease, now with difficulty,—each being a string of verses, which claim to be written without effort and with entire abandon. So the book is a collection of observations, speculations, memories, and prophecies, clad in the simplest, truest, and often the most nervous English,—in the midst of which the reader comes upon something as much out of place as a piece of rotten wood would be among leaves of grass in the meadow, if the meadow had no object but to furnish a child's couch. So slender is the connection, that we hardly injure the following scraps by extracting them.</p><p>'I am the teacher of Athletes;<br>He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own, proves the width of<br>my own;<br>He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher;<br>The boy I love, the same becomes a man, not through derived power, but<br>in his own right,<br> Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,<br>Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,<br>Unrequited love, or a slight, cutting him worse than a wound cuts,<br>First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's-eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a<br>song, or to play on the banjo,<br>Preferring scars, and faces pitted with small-pox, over all latherers and<br>those that keep out of the sun.'<br>Here is the story of the gallant seaman who rescued the passengers<br>on the San Francisco:—<br>'I understand the large heart of heroes,<br>The courage of present times and all times;<br>How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steamship,<br>and death chasing it up and down the storm,<br>How he knuckled tight, and gave not back one inch, and was faithful of<br>days and faithful of nights,<br>And chalked in large letters on a board, 'Be of good cheer, we will not<br>desert you';<br>How he saved the drifting company at last,<br>How the lank, loose-gowned women looked when boated from the side of<br>their prepared graves,<br>How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipped,<br>unshaved men;<br>All this I swallowed, and it tastes good; I like it well, and it becomes<br>mine:<br>I am the man, I suffered, I was there.'</p><p>Claiming in this way a personal interest in every thing that has ever happened in the world, and, by the wonderful sharpness and distinctness of his imagination, making the claim effective and reasonable, Mr. 'Walt Whitman' leaves it a matter of doubt where he has been in this world, and where not. It is very clear, that with him, as with most other effective writers, a keen, absolute memory, which takes in and holds every detail of the past,—as they say the exaggerated power of the memory does when a man is drowning,—is a gift of his organization as remarkable as his vivid imagination. What he has seen once, he has seen for ever. And thus there are in this curious book little thumb-nail sketches of life in the prairie, life in California, life at school, life in the nursery,—life, indeed, we know not where not,—which, as they are unfolded one after another, strike us as real,—so real that we wonder how they came on paper.</p><p>For the purpose of showing that he is above every conventionalism, Mr. Whitman puts into the book one or two lines which he would not address to a woman nor to a company of men. There is not anything, perhaps, which modern usage would stamp as more indelicate than are some passages in Homer. There is not a word in it meant to attract readers by its grossness, as there is in half the literature of the last century, which holds its place unchallenged on the tables of our drawing-rooms. For all that, it is a pity that a book where everything else is natural should go out of the way to avoid the suspicion of being prudish.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS Brooklyn, N.Y. 1855.</p><p>Such is the curt and undescriptive title of a prose poem which has created some remark in certain literary circles. It is in every way a singular volume: singular in its form, singular in its arrangement, singular in its style, and most singular of all in its rhapsodical fancies. Its title-page, as will be seen, bears upon it the name of no author, and the book is ushered into the world without the patronage of any publisher to give it currency and protection. Of 'complimentary copies' for the press, none, so far as we are aware, have been vouchsafed by the writer. Ostrich-like, he has laid his egg in the sand and left it to quicken or not, according to that time and chance which, as the wise man says, happen to all things. We are not left, however, in the body of the work, wholly ignorant of the writer's name, profession, or age—'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshly, and sensual, no sentimentalist, no stander above men or women or apart from them, no more modest than immodest,' is the odd fish who avows himself as the father of this odd volume. Walt Whitman is a printer by trade, whose punctuation is as loose as his morality, and who no more minds his ems than his p's and q's. He tells us that he was born on the last day of May, and 'passed from a babe in the creeping trance of three summers and three winters to articulate and walk,' all which he thinks 'wonderful;' while that he 'grew six feet high and became a man thirty-six years old in 1855, and that he is [I am] here any how,' are facts which he pronounces equally 'wonderful' in the wonder-world of his philosophy.</p><p>Though Walt Whitman has modestly withheld his name from the title-page of his production, he has favored us with his likeness by way of frontispiece to the volume. If the artist has faithfully depicted his effigy, Walt is indeed 'one of the roughs;' for his picture would answer equally well for a 'Bowery boy,'1 one of the 'killers,' 'Mose' in the play, 'Bill Sykes after the murder of Nancy,'2 or the 'B'hoy that runs with the engine,' much as we have known certain 'portraits taken from life' compelled to do duty in pictorial newspapers as the true likeness of half a dozen celebrated criminals. Walt Whitman is evidently the 'representative-man' of the 'roughs.'</p><p>The avowed object of Walter in the loose quarto before us is to 'celebrate' himself; and as the pastoral muse of Virgil 'meditated' on a slender oat straw, so Mr. Whitman 'leans and loafes' at his ease, 'observing a spear of summer grass.' Holy Writ informs us that 'all flesh is grass,' which, according to quaint old Sir Thomas Browne, is just as true literally as metaphorically; for all the adipose matter deposited in the human body from roast beef and mutton is, after all, at the bottom of the account only grass taking upon itself a coat of flesh, for grass forms the ox and roast beef forms the physical man; ergo, the most carnivorous gastronome, no less than the most immaculate vegetarian, is nothing but grass at the last chemical analysis of his constituents. Hence it will be seen that 'grass' is what Mr. Whitman calls a 'uniform hieroglyphic' of the whole human family, and as such deserves to be scanned by the minute philosopher.</p><p>A handful of grass fetched by a child to Walter Whitman inspires him with mysterious thoughts which he vainly essays to grasp, and hints intrusive questionings which he vainly endeavors to answer. At first he guesses that blades of grass 'must be the flag of his disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven,' and anon he guesses they are the 'handkerchief of the Lord,' designedly dropped from above 'as scented gifts and remembrancers.' He next guesses that 'the grass itself is a child, the produced babe of the vegetation,' and now he exclaims, in the next breath, 'it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves,' and hence he feels like caressing it, and breaks out in the following address to the 'curling grass:'</p><p>'It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men;<br>It may be that if I had known them I would have loved them;<br>It may be that you are from old people and from women, and from<br>offspring taken soon out of their mothers' laps,<br>And here you are the mother's lap.</p><p>*****</p><p>What do you think has become of the young and old men?<br>And what do you think has become of the women and children?<br>They are alive and well somewhere.<br>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death;<br>All goes onward and outward…and nothing collapses,<br>And to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier.<br>Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?<br>I hasten to inform him or her that it is just as lucky to die, and I<br>know it.'</p><p>The reader who has proceeded only thus far begins already to discover that Walter Whitman is a pantheist. Without, perhaps, ever having read Spinoza, he is a Spinozist. Without, perhaps, much deep insight into Plato the divine, he is a Platonist 'in the rough,' and believes profoundly in the 'immanence of all in each,' without ever once mouthing that grand phrase of the Greek philosopher. With-out knowing how to chop the formal logic of the schools, he is a necessitarian and fatalist, with whom 'whatever is is right.' The world as he finds it, and man as he is, good or bad, high or low, ignorant or learned, holy or vicious, are all alike good enough for Walter Whitman, who is in himself a 'kosmos,' and whose emotional nature is at once the sensorium of humanity and the sounding board which catches up and intones each note of joy or sorrow in the 'gamut of human feeling.'</p><p>He represents himself as being alike of the old and the young, of the foolish as much as the wise; maternal in his instincts as well as paternal; a child as well as a man; a Southerner as soon as a Northerner; a planter, nonchalant and hospitable; a Yankee, bound his own way and ever ready for a swap; a Kentuckian, walking the trail of the Elkhorn with deerskin leggings; a boatman over the lakes or bays or along coasts; a Hoosier, a Badger, a Wolverine, a Buckeye, a Louisianian, a 'poke-easy' from sandbills and pines: at home equally on the hills of Vermont, or in the woods of Maine, or the Texas ranch; a learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfulest, a farmer, mechanic, or artist, a gentleman, sailor, lover, or quaker, a prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, or priest. He rejoices to feel that he is 'not stuck up and is in his [my] place,' for</p><p>'The moth and the fish eggs are in their place:<br>The suns I see and the suns I cannot see are in their place;<br>The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.'</p><p>So fully has the world-spirit possessed the soul of Walter that he thinks he could turn and live awhile with the animals; 'they are so placid and self-contained' that he sometimes 'stands and looks at them half the day long.'</p><p>They do not sweat and whine about their condition;They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins;They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God.</p><p>Mr. Whitman's philosophy, it will be seen, is somewhat different from Blaise Pascal's, and we hope we shall not hurt Mr. W's feelings if we venture to give to the devout Jansenist a slight precedence over him. Pascal, the poor man, having no better guides than his own august reason and the oracles of divine inspiration, in his profound speculations on the greatness and misery of man, came to the conclusion that man's consciousness of his misery was one of the most signal and primary proofs of his greatness. These anxious longings of the soul as for an unknown good were to his mind the indication of slumbering capacities not yet developed, and revealed that power of introspection and self-scrutiny which is at once the attribute of consciousness and the attestation of human responsibility. The man who degrades himself to the level of the brutes, or sinks even lower than they, does yet by his very nature rise above them in that he is conscious of his degradation. At least so thought Pascal, and so think still all those who find in man's consciousness the proof of his dignity and of his elevation above the brute creation.</p><p>Mr. Whitman thinks, however, he would like to turn and live awhile with the animals. Well, one's associates should certainly be determined according to one's tastes. Every one to his liking, as remarked the venerable dame in the proverb when she kissed her cow. De gustibus, &c. Mr. Whitman, it is true, can plead royal example and ancient precedent in defence of his 'passional attraction' towards the dumb animals. King Nebuchadnezzar, many years before him, consorted with the oxen of the field and went to graze after the most approved style of the bovine quadruped. We do not read, however, that his majesty greatly relished this species of out door life, and all, we doubt doubt [sic] because, 'unlike one of the roughs,' he failed to remark how 'placid and self-contained' were his companions of the herd. Nebuchadnezzar too, it is to be feared, lacked the proper pantheistic instincts to permit his entering fully into the sublime mysteries of Serapis3 and Anubis.4 If his life-experiences had been the same as 'Walt Whitman's' before undergoing his change, he might have managed better to enjoy his new society.</p><p>In the 'Golden Ass' of Apuleius we have also another record of life among the animals. We need not repeat the story of Fotis's ill-starred lover and his magical transformation into an ass, with the long series of misfortunes, the cudgellings and flayings which, sad to tell, befell him in that condition. Are they not all written in the 'golden' book aforesaid?—a book which Mr. Whitman, we are sure, would find very much after his own heart in its freedom from anything like sentimental refinement or prudish delicacy, while it is to be hoped that its faithful portraiture of life among the graminivors [grass eaters] would cure him of his disposition to herd awhile with the quadrupeds, and render him willing to content himself with his present advantages in the privilege of 'standing and looking at them half the day long.' It behooves him also to bear in mind that according to all accounts the condition of the Irish peasantry is not greatly elevated over 'the rest of mankind' by their hereditary custom of assigning to the 'placid' porker and domestic cow a cozy corner in the cabin along with its other inmates. If much good was to be expected from turning and living with the animals, Ireland would have convinced the world of it long before Mr. Whitman's day, and if he had properly studied her history we question whether he would have considered it a matter worth boasting of that he feels himself—</p><p>'Stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over.'</p><p>As we do not wish, however, to press Mr. Whitman too hard upon this point, and seek to exhibit rather the philosophy of his teachings than his petits ridicules, we append in this same connection the following lyrical outburst of the true pantheistic spirit:</p><p>How beautiful and perfect are the animals! How perfect is my soul!<br>How perfect the earth and the minutest thing upon it!<br>What is called good is perfect, and what is called sin is just as<br>perfect.<br>The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and imponderable<br>fluids are perfect.<br>Oh, my soul! If I realize you I have satisfaction. Laws of the earth<br>and air! If I realize you I have satisfaction.<br>I swear I see now that every thing has a living soul!<br>The trees have, rooted in the ground; the weeds of the sea have;<br>the animals!</p><p>It is quite possible that, owing to some radical and congenital defect of our mental organization, we have never been able to penetrate 'within the veil' in the Pantheon of the transcendentalists and of the Emersonian school in general. Mr. Emerson, we understand, greatly admires the present work; indeed, we have read a published letter of his in which he tenders to Mr. Whitman his thanks for the Leaves of Grass. When we read that eulogy we were satisfied that this volume would prove to us a sealed book, and that its hieroglyphs would be as unintelligible to our ken as was the inscription around the sacred ibex to the erudite Mr. George Robins Gliddon.5 Still we determined to read it, in the humble but earnest hope of endeavoring occasionally to catch its esoteric meaning in a few at least of those passages, which we are assured from Mr. Emerson's enjoyment of them must contain a hidden significance which nothing less potent than the magic salve of the dervise of Balsora can open our eyes to behold; and in default of which we must be content with such a poor comprehension of these Sibylline leaves as falls to the lot of common readers.</p><p>No one, we may say, however, in all candor, can read this singular prose-poem without being struck by the writer's wonderful powers of description and of word-painting. His memory seems as retentive of its treasures as his imagination is opulent in its creations. He writes like one who has but to prick his mind and forthwith it gushes out in a perennial flow of 'thoughts which have tarried in its inner chambers.' It is only when we are balked in our attempt to trail his transcendental sinuosities of thought that we feel ourselves at fault, and then we are reminded of Longfellow's description of the Emersonian philosophy, which he likened to some of the roads in our great West, which at first open very fair and wide, and are shaded on both sides by the towering giants of the primeval forest, but which before long become narrower and narrower and at last dwindle to a squirrel path and run up a tree.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS. Entered according to Act of Congress, by Walter Whitman, &c., &c., Brooklyn.</p><p>A new edition, we believe, of the famous Whitman's poems, which made such a flutter among the 'gray goose quills' of this city and 'other quarters of the globe' some time ago. Of the poem which occupies the ninety-five pages of this folio, we have before briefly spoken. Upon examining it a second time, and pondering its aims and expressions, we feel constrained to say that it is certainly the strangest, most extraordinary production we have ever attempted to peruse. Still, like the rest of our countrymen, we are by no means either averse to extraordinary things or afraid of them. We enjoy enterprise in speech and writing as thoroughly as in steam vessels, revolving rifles or new-found Nicaraguas. Therefore we shall not quarrel with Mr. Whitman for being odd. Oddness is the normal condition of some natures—of the freshest and best, perhaps—at least when it means frankness and opposition to solemn propriety, alias humbug and red tape.</p><p>Mr. Whitman's preface is what the hum-drum world calls 'queer' as entirely perhaps as his poem, yet we think a great deal of it both finely and bravely uttered as well as true. None can, more than we do, entirely hate that cant which always ascribes this or that kind of writing to this or the other 'school,' as if the young author had necessarily in every instance copied some model; as if two similarly constituted minds may not naturally seek similar expression! It is precisely this stupid, stereotyped classification adopted by indolent or clique-led reviewers, that has produced so many abortions in literature through the straining after at least the appearance of total originality, but to give future readers of this book some indication of its style, ere they have opened it, we will say that it is Germanic and Carlylean—even Emersonian—sometimes in the strain of Martin Farquhar Tupper,1 although far stronger and more pointed than the latter.</p><p>The poem exhibits undoubted and striking evidence of genius and power. But the author reasoning that the spirit of the American people, nay, of any people is chiefly represented by its uncultivated though, perhaps, naturally intelligent classes, falls into the error of mistaking their frequent uncouthness as a fair revelation of that spirit, and the bathos often produced in some of his finest passages by the presence of this idea defaces his work and repels hundreds of candid minds who would be eager to acknowledge his claims, but are thus prevented from reading enough to recognize them.</p><p>In glancing rapidly over the 'Leaves of Grass' you are puzzled whether to set the author down as a madman or an opium eater; when you have studied them you recognize a poet of extraordinary vigor, nay even beauty of thought, beneath the most fantastic possible garments of diction. If Hamlet had gone mad, in Ophelia's way, as well as in his own, and in addition to his own vein of madness, he might, when transported to our own age and country, have talked thus.</p><p>In a crush hat and red shirt open at the neck, without waistcoat or jacket, one hand on his hip and the other thrust into his pocket, Walt Whitman the b'hoy poet, on his muscle, writes sentences like these:</p><p>'A child said, What is grass?—fetching it to me with<br>full hands.<br>How could I answer the child…I do not know what it<br>is any more than he.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of<br>graves.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of<br>old mothers.<br>Darker than the colorless bears of old men,<br>Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.<br>Oh I perceive, after all, so many uttering tongues!<br>And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths<br>for nothing.[']</p><p>Again:</p><p>[']Press close, bare bosomed night!

Mad naked Summer night!</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths!<br>Sea of the brine of life! Sea of unshovelled and always ready<br>graves!'</p><p>His own picture:</p><p>'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a Kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual…eating, drinking and breeding,<br>No sentimentalist…no stander above men and women or<br>apart from the,…no more modest than immodest.'</p><p>Yet, he is a sentimentalist!

Then he is</p><p>'Pleased with primitive tunes of the choir of the white-<br>washed church,'</p><p>And then you see him</p><p>'Walking the old hills of Judea with the beautiful gentle<br>god by his side.'</p><p>Now, with him, we</p><p>'Visit the orchards of God, and look at quintillions green.'</p><p>Or</p><p>'Go hunting polar furs and the seal…leaping chasms<br>with a pike-pointed staff…clinging to topples<br>of brittle and blue.[']</p><p>Read this noble passage:</p><p>'How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of<br>steamship, and death chasing it up and down the storm,<br>How he knuckled tight and gave not back one inch, and was<br>faithful of days and faithful of nights,<br>And chalked in large letters on a board; Be of good cheer,<br>We will not desert you;<br>How he saved the drifting company at last,<br> How the lank loose-gowned women looked when boated from<br>the side of their prepared graves.<br>How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the<br>sharp-lipped unshaven men;[.]'</p><p>We are tempted to quote many strophes from this remarkable collection of genius inebriated with its own overflowing fountains of fancy, but must conclude with the following fine lines, referring to past struggles for freedom, and predicting a future:</p><p>Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves…bloody corpses<br>of young men:<br>The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily…the bullets of princes<br>are flying…the creatures of power laugh aloud,<br>And all these things bear fruits…and they are good.<br>Those corpses of young men,<br>Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets…those hearts pierced<br>by the gray lead,<br>Cold and motionless as they seem…live elsewhere with<br> unslaughter'd vitality.<br>They live in other young men, O kings,<br>They live in brothers, again ready to defy you:<br>They were purified by death…They were taught and exalted.<br>Not a grave of the murdered for freedom but grows seed for<br>freedom…in its turn to bear seed,<br>Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the<br>snows nourish.<br>Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,<br>But it stalks invisibly over the earth…whispering counseling<br>cautioning.<br>Liberty let others despair of you…I never despair of you.<br>Is the house shut? Is the master away?<br>Nevertheless be ready…be not weary of watching,<br>He will soon return…his messengers come anon.</p><p>For the sum of 75 cents any reader may accompany Whitman through a poetic chaos—bright, dark, splendid, common, ridiculous and sublime—in which are floating the nebulae and germs of matter for a starry universe of organized and harmonious systems that may yet revolve, in all the magnificence of artistic order, through the highest heaven of fame!</p><p>As proof that whatever may be the merits or demerits of this singular production, we may state that very many thousand copies have been sold and the demand is still increasing.</p><p>We have before us one of the most extraordinary specimens of Yankee intelligence and American eccentricity in authorship, it is possible to conceive. It is of a genus so peculiar as to embarrass us, and has an air at once so novel, so audacious, and so strange as to verge upon absurdity, and yet it would be an injustice to pronounce it so, as the work is saved from this extreme by a certain mastery over diction not very easy of definition. What Emerson has pronounced to be good must not be lightly treated, and before we pronounce upon the merits of this performance it is but right to examine them. We have, then, a series of pithy prose sentences strung together—forming twelve grand divisions in all, but which, having a rude rhythmical cadence about them admit of the designation poetical being applied. They are destitute of rhyme, measure of feet, and the like, every condition under which poetry is generally understood to exist being absent; but in their strength of expression, their fervor, hearty wholesomeness, their originality, mannerism, and freshness, one finds in them a singular harmony and flow, as if by reading, they gradually formed themselves into melody, and adopted characteristics peculiar and appropriate to themselves alone. If, however, some sentences be fine, there are others altogether laughable; nevertheless, in the bare strength, the unhesitating frankness of a man who 'believes in the flesh and the appetites,' and who dares to call simplest things by their plainest names, conveying also a large sense of the beautiful, and with an emphasis which gives a clearer conception of what manly modesty really is than any thing we have, in all conventional forms of word, deed, or act so far known of, that we rid ourselves, little by little, of the strangeness with which we greet this bluff new-comer, and, beginning to understand him better, appreciate him in proportion as he becomes more known. He will soon make his way into the confidence of his readers, and his poems in time will become a pregnant text-book, out of which quotation as sterling as the minted gold will be taken and applied to every form and phase of the 'inner' or the 'outer' life; and we express our pleasure in making the acquaintance of Walt Whitman, hoping to know more of him in time to come.</p><p>We have received a volume, bound in green, and bearing the above title, under rather singular circumstances. Not only does the donor send us the book, but he favours us with hints—pretty broad hints—towards a favourable review of it. He has pasted in the first page a number of notices extracted with the scissors from American newspapers, and all magnificently eulogistic of Leaves of Grass. So original a proceeding merits an exceptional course; and therefore we shall confine ourselves to laying before our readers, first, the opinions of the American reviewers, and next giving specimens of the work reviewed. The relation of the two classes of extracts is curiously illustrative of contemporary American criticism.</p><p>The first panegyrist is not a newspaper writer, but the 'Representative Man,' Ralph Waldo Emerson:—</p><p>DEAR SIR,—I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of Leaves of Grass. I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed. I am very happy in reading it, as great power makes us happy. It meets the demand I am always making of what seemed the sterile and stingy nature, as if too much handiwork, or too much lymph in the temperament, were making our Western wits fat and mean.</p><p>I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things said incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.</p><p>I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere, for such a start. I rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this sunbeam were no illusion; but the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.</p><p>R. W. EMERSON.</p><p>From the Brooklyn Daily Times we take a description of Mr. Walt Whitman, the author of Leaves of Grass:—</p><p>He never offers others; what he continually offers is the man whom our Brooklynites know so well. Of pure American breed, of reckless health, his body perfect, free from taint from top to toe, free for ever from headache and dyspepsia, full-blooded, six feet high, a good feeder, never once using medicine, drinking water only—a swimmer in the river or bay or by the seashore—of straight attitude and slow movement on foot—an indescribable style evincing indifference and disdain—ample limbed, weight a hundred and eighty-five pounds, age thirty-six years [1855]—never dressed in black, always dressed freely and clean in strong clothes, neck open, shirt collar flat and broad, countenance of swarthy transparent red, beard short and well mottled with white, hair like hay after it has been mowed in the field and lies tossed and streaked—face not refined or intellectual, but calm and wholesome—a face of an unaffected animal—a face that absorbs the sunshine and meets savage or gentleman on equal terms.</p><p>The American Phrenological Journal contrasts the poet of Leaves of Grass with Tennyson:—</p><p>The best of the school of poets at present received in Great Britain and America is Alfred Tennyson. He is the bard of ennui and of the aristocracy, and their combination into love. This love is the old stock love of playwrights and romancers, Shakespeare the same as the rest. It is possessed of the same unnatural and shocking passion for some girl or woman, that wrenches it from its manhood, emasculated and impotent, without strength to hold the rest of the objects and goods of life in their proper positions. It seeks nature for sickly uses. It goes screaming and weeping after the facts of the universe, in their calm beauty and equanimity, to note the occurrence of itself, and to sound the news, in connexion with the charms of the neck, hair, or complexion of a particular female…</p><p>Not a borrower from other lands, but a prodigal user of his own land is Walt Whitman. Not the refined life of the drawing-room—not dancing, and polish, and gentility, but some powerful uneducated person, and some harsh identity of sound, and all wild free forms, are grateful to him. A thrill of his own likeness strikes him as the spotted hawk wheels noisily near his head at nightfall, and he is fain to say,—</p><p>I too am not a bit tamed—I too am untranslatable;<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p><p>The United States Review discovers in Mr. Whitman the founder of an indigenous school of American poetry:—</p><p>Self-reliant, with haughty eyes, assuming to himself all the attributes of his country, steps Walt Whitman into literature, talking like a man unaware that there was ever hitherto such a production as a book, or such a being as a writer. Every move of him has the free play of the muscle of one who never knew what it was to feel that he stood in the presence of a superior. Every word that falls from his mouth shows silent disdain and defiance of the old theories and forms. Every phrase announces new laws; not once do his lips unclose except in conformity with them. With light and rapid touch he first indicates in prose the principles of the foundation of a race of poets so deeply to spring from the American people, and become ingrained through them, that their Presidents shall not be the common referees so much as that great race of poets shall. He proceeds himself to exemplify this new school, and set models for their expression and range of subjects. He makes audacious and native use of his own body and soul. He must recreate poetry with the elements always at hand. He must inbue it with himself as he is, disorderly, fleshy, and sensual, a lover of things, yet a lover of men and women above the whole of the other objects of the universe. His work is to be achieved by unusual methods. Neither classic nor romantic is he, nor a materialist any more than a spiritualist. Not a whisper comes out of him of the old stock talk and rhyme of poetry—not the first recognition of gods or goddesses, or Greece or Rome. No breath of Europe, or her monarchies or priestly conventions, or her notions of gentlemen and ladies founded on the idea of caste, seems ever to have fanned his face or been inhaled into his lungs. But in their stead pour vast and fluid the fresh mentality of this mighty age, and the realities of this mighty continent, and the sciences, and inventions, and discoveries of the present world. Not geology, nor mathematics, nor chemistry, nor navigation, nor astronomy, nor anatomy, nor phrenology, nor engineering, is more true to itself than Walt Whitman is true to them. They and the other sciences underlie his whole superstructure. In the beauty of the work of the poet, he affirms, are the tuft and final applause of science.</p><p>Now for the pièces justifcatives. The exordium of Leaves of Grass is as follows:—</p><p>I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.<br>I loafe and invite my soul,<br>I lean and loafe at my ease…observing a spear of summer grass.<br>Houses and rooms are full of perfumes…the shelves are<br>crowded with perfumes,<br>I breathe the fragrance myself, and know it and like it,<br>The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.<br>The atmosphere is not a perfume . . . . it has no taste of<br>the distillation…<br>It is odorless,<br>It is for my mouth forever…I am in love with it,<br>I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised<br>and naked,<br>I am mad for it to be in contact with me.</p><p>A little further on, the poet describes the subject of his poem, viz., himself:—</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly fleshy and sensual…eating drinking and breeding,<br>No sentimentalist…no stander above men and woman or apart<br>from them…no more modest than immodest.<br>Unscrew the locks from the doors!<br>Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!<br>Whoever degrades another degrades me…and whatever is<br>done or said returns at last to me,<br>And whatever I do or say I also return.</p><p>The title of the poem is explained at page 16:—</p><p>A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with<br>full hands;<br>How could I answer the child?…I do not know what it<br>is any more than he.<br>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of<br>hopeeful green stuff woven.<br>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,<br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we<br>may see and remark, and say Whose?<br>Or I guess the grass is itself a child…the produced babe<br>of the vegetation.<br>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>And it means, sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,<br>Growing among black folks as among white,<br>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I<br>receive them the same.<br>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.</p><p>Mr. Whitman speculates on Humanity:—</p><p>What is a man anyhow? What am I? and what are you?<br>All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,<br>Else it were time lost listening to me.<br>I do not snivel that snivel the world over,<br>That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and filth,<br>That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at the end but thread-<br>bare crape and tears.<br>Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids…conformity<br>goes to the fourth-removed,<br>I cock my hat as I please indoors or out.<br>hall I pray? Shall I venerate and be ceremonious?<br>I have pried through the strata and analysed to a hair,<br>And counselled with doctors and calculated close and found no sweeter fat<br>than sticks to my own bones.</p><p>Shortly afterwards the poet applies his theory of humanity to himself:—</p><p>I know I am august,<br>I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,<br>I see that the elementary laws never apologize<br>I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by after all.<br>I exist as I am, that is enough,<br>If no other in the world be aware I sit content.<br>And if each and all be aware I sit content.</p><p>Our last extract embodies Mr. Whitman's theological creed:—</p><p>And I call to mankind, Be not curious about God,<br>For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,<br>No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about<br>death.<br>I hear and behold God in every object, yet I understand<br>God not in the least,<br>Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than<br>myself.<br>Why should I wish to see God better than this day?<br>I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment<br>then,<br>In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass;<br>I find letters from God dropped in the street, and every one is signed by<br>God's name,<br>And I leave them where they are, for I know that others will punctually<br>come for ever and ever.</p><p>After poetry like this, and criticism like this, it seems strange that we cannot recommend the book to our readers' perusal. But the truth is, that after every five or six pages of matter such as we have quoted, Mr. Whitman suddenly becomes exceedingly intelligible, but exceedingly obscene. If the Leaves of Grass should come into anybody's possession, our advice is to throw them instantly behind the fire.</p><p>Leaves of Grass Brooklyn, New York.</p><p>We have too long overlooked in this country the great poet who has recently arisen in America, of whom some of his countrymen speak in connection with Bacon and Shakespeare, whom others compare with Tennyson,—much to the disadvantage of our excellent laureate,—and to whom Mr Emerson writes that he finds in his book 'incomparable things, said incomparably well.' The book he pronounces 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed;' at which, indeed, says Mr Emerson in the printed letter sent to us,—'I rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this sunbeam were no illusion.'</p><p>No illusion truly is Walt Whitman, the new American prodigy, who, as he is himself candid enough to intimate, sounds his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world. He is described by one of his own local papers as 'a tenderly affectionate, rowdyish, contemplative, sensual, moral, susceptible, and imperious person,' who aspires to cast some of his own grit, whatever that may be, into literature. We have ourselves been disposed to think there is in literature grit enough, according to the ordinary sense, but decidedly Walt Whitman tosses in some more. The author describes himself as 'one of the roughs, a kosmos;' indeed, he seems to be very much impressed with the fact that he is a kosmos, and repeats it frequently. A kosmos we may define, from the portrait of it on the front of the book, as a gentleman in his shirt-sleeves, with one hand in a pocket of his pantaloons, and his wide-awake cocked with a dammee-sir air over his forehead.</p><p>On the other hand, according to an American review that flatters Mr Whitman, this kosmos is 'a compound of the New England transcendentalist and New York rowdy.'</p><p>But as such terms of compliment may not be quite clear to English readers, we must be content, in simpler fashion, to describe to them this Brooklyn boy as a wild Tupper1 of the West. We can describe him perfectly by a few suppositions. Suppose that Mr Tupper had been brought up to the business of an auctioneer, then banished to the backwoods, compelled to live for a long time as a backwoodsman, and thus contracting a passion for the reading of Emerson and Carlyle? Suppose him maddened by this course of reading, and fancying himself not only an Emerson but a Carlyle and an American Shakespeare to boot when the fits come on, and putting forth his notion of that combination in his own self-satisfied way, and in his own wonderful cadences? In that state he would write a book exactly like Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass.</p><p>Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,<br>Say old topknot; what do you want?<br>Man or woman!

His verse has a purpose. He desires to assert the pleasure that a man has in himself, his body and its sympathies, his mind (in a lesser degree, however) and its sympathies. He asserts man's right to express his delight in animal enjoyment, and the harmony in which he should stand, body and soul, with fellow men and the whole universe. To express this, and to declare that the poet is the highest manifestation of this, generally also to suppress shams, is the purport of these Leaves of Grass. Perhaps it might have been done as well, however, without being always so purposely obscene, and intentionally foul-mouthed, as Mr Whitman is.</p><p>I think I could turn and live awhile with the animals . . . . they are so placid<br>and self-contained,<br>I stand and look at them sometimes half the day long.<br>They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,<br>No one is dissatisfied . . . . not one is demented with the mania of owning<br>things,<br>Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,<br>Not one is respectable or industrious over the whole earth.<br>So they show their relations to me and I accept them;<br>They bring me tokens of myself . . . . they evince them plainly in their posses-<br>sion.</p><p>The fit being very strong indeed upon him, our Wild Tupper of the West thus puts into words his pleasure at the hearing of an overture:</p><p>The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,<br>It wrenches unnamable ardors from my breast,<br>It throbs me to gulps of the farthest down horror,<br>It sails me . . . .

We must add now, to complete the imitation of Walt Whitman, that the wild philosopher and poet, as conceived by us, should be perpetually haunted by the delusion that he has a catalogue to make. Three-fourths of Walt Whitman's book is poetry as catalogues of auctioneers are poems. Whenever any general term is used, off the mind wanders on this fatal track, and an attempt is made to specify all lots included under it. Does Mr Whitman speak of a town, he is at once ready with pages of town lots. Does he mention the American country, he feels bound thereupon to draw up a list of barns, waggons, wilds, mountains, animals, trees, people, 'a Hoosier, a Badger, a Backeye, a Lousianian, or Georgian, a poke-easy from sandhills and pines,' etc., etc. We will give an illustration of this form of lunacy. The subject from which the patient starts off is equivalent to things in general, and we can spare room only for half the catalogue. It will be enough, however, to show how there arises catalogue within catalogue, and how sorely the paroxysm is aggravated by the incidental mention of any one particular that is itself again capable of subdivision into lots.</p><p>The usual routine . . . . the workshop, factory, yard, office, store, or desk;<br>The jaunt of hunting or fishing, or the life of hunting or fishing,<br>Pasturelife, foddering, milking and herding, and all the personnel and usages;<br>The plum-orchard and apple-orchard . . . . gardening . . seedlings, cuttings,<br>flowers and vines,<br>Grains and manures . . marl, clay, loam . . the subsoil plough . . the shovel and<br>pick and rake and hoe . . irrigation and draining;<br>The currycomb . . the horse-cloth . . the halter and bridle and bits . . the very<br>wisps of straw,<br>The barn and barn-yard . . the bins and mangers . . the mows and racks:<br>Manufactures . . commerce . . engineering . . the building of cities, and every<br>trade carried on there . . and the implements of every trade,<br>The anvil and tongs and hammer . . the axe and wedge . . the square and mitre<br>and jointer and smoothingplane;<br>The plumbob and trowel and level . . the wall-scaffold, and the work of walls and<br>ceilings . . or any mason-work:<br>The ship's compass . . the sailor's tarpaulin . . the stays and lanyards, and the<br>ground-tackle for anchoring or mooring,<br>The sloop's tiller . . the pilot's wheel and bell . . the yacht or fish-smack . .<br>the great gay-pennanted three-hundred-foot steamboat under full head-<br>way, with her proud fat breasts and her delicate swift-flashing paddles;<br>The trail and line and hooks and sinkers . . the seine, and hauling the seine;<br>Smallarms and rifles . . . . the powder and shot and caps and wadding . . . . the<br>ordnance for war . . . . the carriages:<br>Everyday objects . . . . the housechairs, the carpet, the bed and the counterpane<br>of the bed, and him or her sleeping at night, and the wind blowing, and<br>the indefinite noises:<br>The snowstorm or rainstorm . . . . the tow-trowsers . . . . the lodge-hut in the<br>woods, and the still-hunt:<br>City and country . . fireplace and candle . . gaslight and heater and aqueduct;<br>The message of the governor, mayor, or chief of police . . . . the dishes of break-<br>fast or dinner or supper;<br>The bunkroom, the fire-engine, the string-team, and the car or truck behind;<br>The paper I write on or you write on . . and every word we write . . and every<br>cross and twirl of the pen . . and the curious way we write what we<br>think . . . . yet very faintly;<br>The directory, the detector, the ledger . . . . the books in ranks or the book-<br>shelves. . . . the clock attached to the wall,<br>The ring on your finger . . the lady's wristlet . . the hammers of stonebreakers or<br>coppersmiths . . the druggist's vials and jars;<br>The etui of surgical instruments, and the etui of oculist's or aurist's instruments,<br>or dentist's instruments;<br>Glassblowing, grinding of wheat and corn . . casting, and what is cast . . tin-<br>roofing, shingledressing,<br>Shipcarpentering, flagging of sidewalks by flaggers . . dockbuilding, fishcuring,<br>ferrying;<br>The pump, the piledriver, the great derrick . . the coalkiln and brickkiln,<br>Ironworks or whiteleadworks . . the sugarhouse . . steam-saws, and the great<br>mills and factories;<br>The cottonbale . . the stevedore's hook . . the saw and buck of the sawyer . .<br>the screen of the coalscreener . . the mould of the moulder . . the work-<br>ingknife of the butcher;<br>The cylinder press . . the handpress . . the frisket and tympan . . the composi-<br>tor's stick and rule,<br>The implements for daguerreotyping . . . . the tools of the rigger or grappler or<br>sailmaker or blockmaker,<br>Goods of guttapercha or papiermache . . . . colors and brushes . . . . glaziers'<br>implements.</p><p>Now let us compare with this a real auctioneer's catalogue. We will take that of Goldsmith's2 chambers, by way of departing as little as we can from the poetical. For, as Mr Whitman would say (and here we quote quite literally, prefixing only a verse of our own, from 'A Catalogue of the Household Furniture with the select collection of scarce, curious, and valuable books of Dr Goldsmith, deceased, which, by order of the admr, will be sold by auction, &c., &c.)—</p><p>Surely the house of a poet is a poem, and behold a poet in the auctioneer who tells<br>you the whole lot of it,—<br>The bath stone, compass front, open border, fender, shovel, tongs, and poker,<br>The blue moreen festoon window-curtain . . . the mahogany dining-table on the<br>floor,<br>The six ditto hollow seat chairs covered with blue moreen,<br>Covered with blue moreen and finished with a double row of brass nails and check<br>cases,<br>The Wilton carpet . . . sun shade, line and pulleys . . . the deal sideboard<br>stained,<br>* * * *<br>The teapot, five coffee cups, sugar basin and cover . . . four saucers and six cups,<br>Two quart decanters and stoppers . . . one plain ditto . . . eleven glasses, one<br>wine and water glass,<br>A pair of bellows and a brush . . . a footman, copper tea-kettle and coalscuttle.<br>Two pairs of plated candlesticks.<br> A mahogany teaboard, a pet bordered ditto . . . a large round japanned ditto and<br>two waiters.<br>The Tragic Muse in a gold frame.</p><p>After all, we are not sure whether the poetry of that excellent Mr Good, the auctioneer who, at his Great Room, No. 121 Fleet street, sold the household furniture of Oliver Goldsmith in the summer of 1774, does not transcend in wisdom and in wit 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that' (according to Mr Emerson) 'America has yet contributed.'</p><p>[ . . .] We have still said nothing of Mr. Ernest Jones’s war strains; of a new poem by the American poet, Mr. Buchanan Reade—a gracefully rhymed, imaginative story; or of another American production which, according to some Transatlantic critics, is to initiate a new school of poetry. This is a poem called 'Leaves of Grass,'† and, instead of criticizing it, we will give a short extract, typical in every respect, except that it contains none of the very bold expressions by which the author indicates his contempt for the “prejudices” of decency.</p><p>'A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;<br>How could I answer the child?…I do not know what it is any<br>more than he.<br>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful<br>green stuff woven.<br>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,<br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we<br>may see and remark, and say Whose?<br>Or I guess the grass is itself a child…the produced babe of<br>the vegetation.<br>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones<br>Growing among black folks as among white,<br>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I<br>receive them the same.<br>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.</p><p>. . . .</p> <p>I think I could turn and live awhile with the animals…<br>they are so placid and self-contained,<br>I stand and look at them sometimes half the day long.<br>They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,<br>Not one is dissatisfied…not one is demented with the<br>mania of owning things,<br>Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived<br>thousands of years ago,<br>Not one is respectable or industrious over the whole earth.'</p><p>There is the name neither of author nor publisher to this singular book—one of the most singular that has ever come under our notice. Appearing at the first glance to be mere unconnected common-place remarks, aphorisms, and opinions, there is yet developed, on further examination, a vast amount of undisciplined power. Many of the lines are such perfect pictures in themselves, that an artist might draw them without reference to any other material, and produce beautiful pictorial compositions. Other portions of the book are perfectly kaleidoscopic—grotesque changes rapidly succeed each other; and no one save the author himself—and he, perhaps, not an exception—can explain them. Had the elder D'Israeli met with 'Leaves of Grass,' he would have assuredly included it in his 'Curiosities of Literature.' The book is embellished with a portrait (we presume) of the author—a rather melancholy-looking gentleman, with a wide-awake hat on, and neither coat nor vest. Among the 'Leaves of Grass,' certainly the author himself is not the least remarkable 'blade.' </p><p>XXI.— Leaves of Grass Horsell, London, 1856.</p><p>'We have glanced through this book with disgust and astonishment;—astonishment that anyone can be found who would dare to print such a farrago of rubbish,—lucubrations more like the ravings of a drunkard, or one half crazy, than anything which a man in his senses could think it fit to offer to the consideration of his fellow men. Where these bald, confused, disjointed, caricatures of blank verse have any meaning, it is generally indecent; several times execrably profane. We should not have bestowed one line of notice upon such an insult to common sense and common propriety, as this book but that, to our unspeakable surprise, we find bound up with it extracts from various American papers highly laudatory of this marvellous production: and we think it right to call the attention of our American readers to the fact, that any (even of the meanest) of their literary critics, should be mistaken enough to lend a sanction to such trash as this.'</p><p>Leaves of Grass New York. 1855. London. Horsell.</p><p>WE had ceased, we imagined, to be surprised at anything that America could produce. We had become stoically indifferent to her Woolly Horses, her Mermaids, her Sea Serpents, her Barnums,1 and her Fanny Ferns;2 but the last monstrous importation from Brooklyn, New York, has scattered our indifference to the winds. Here is a thin quarto volume without an author's name on the title-page; but to atone for which we have a portrait engraved on steel of the notorious individual who is the poet presumptive. This portrait expresses all the features of the hard democrat, and none of the flexile delicacy of the civilised poet. The damaged hat, the rough beard, the naked throat, the shirt exposed to the waist, are each and all presented to show that the man to whom those articles belong scorns the delicate arts of civilisation. The man is the true impersonation of his book—rough, uncouth, vulgar. It was by the merest accident that we discovered the name of this erratic and newest wonder; but at page 29 we find that he is—</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a Kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshly, and sensual.</p><p>The words 'an American' are a surplusage, 'one of the roughs' too painfully apparent; but what is intended to be conveyed by 'a Kosmos' we cannot tell, unless it means a man who thinks that the fine essence of poetry consists in writing a book which an American reviewer is compelled to declare is 'not to be read aloud to a mixed audience.' We should have passed over this book, Leaves of Grass, with indignant contempt, had not some few Transatlantic critics attempted to 'fix' this Walt Whitman as the poet who shall give a new and independent literature to America—who shall form a race of poets as Banquo's issue formed a line of kings. Is it possible that the most prudish nation in the world will adopt a poet whose indecencies stink in the nostrils? We hope not; and yet there is a probability, and we will show why, that this Walt Whitman will not meet with the stern rebuke which he so richly deserves. America has felt, oftener perhaps than we have declared, that she has no national poet—that each one of her children of song has relied too much on European inspiration, and clung too fervently to the old conventionalities. It is therefore not unlikely that she may believe in the dawn of a thoroughly original literature, now there has arisen a man who scorns the Hellenic deities, who has no belief in, perhaps because he has no knowledge of, Homer and Shakspere; who relies on his own rugged nature, and trusts to his own rugged language, being himself what he shows in his poems. Once transfix him as the genesis of a new era, and the manner of the man may be forgiven or forgotten. But what claim has this Walt Whitman to be thus considered, or to be considered a poet at all? We grant freely enough that he has a strong relish for nature and freedom, just as an animal has; nay, further, that his crude mind is capable of appreciating some of nature's beauties; but it by no means follows that, because nature is excellent, therefore art is contemptible. Walt Whitman is, as unacquainted with art, as a hog is with mathematics. His poems—we must call them so for convenience—twelve in number, are innocent of rhythm, and resemble nothing so much as the war-cry of the Red Indians. Indeed, Walt Whitman has had near and ample opportunities of studying the vociferations of a few amiable savages. Or rather perhaps, this Walt Whitman reminds us of Caliban3 flinging down his logs, and setting himself to write a poem. In fact Caliban, and not Walt Whitman, might have written this:</p><p>I too am not a bit tamed—I too am untranslatable.<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p><p>Is this man with the 'barbaric yawp' to push Longfellow into the shade, and he meanwhile to stand and 'make mouths' at the sun? The chance of this might be formidable were it not ridiculous. That object or that act which most develops the ridiculous element carries in its bosom the seeds of decay, and is wholly powerless to trample out of God's universe one spark of the beautiful. We do not, then, fear this Walt Whitman, who gives us slang in the place of melody, and rowdyism in the place of regularity. The depth of his indecencies will be the grave of his fame, or ought to be if all proper feeling is not extinct. The very nature of this man's compositions excludes us from proving by extracts the truth of our remarks; but we, who are not prudish, emphatically declare that the man who wrote page 79 of the Leaves of Grass deserves nothing so richly as the public executioner's whip. Walt Whitman libels the highest type of humanity, and calls his free speech the true utterance of a man: we, who may have been misdirected by civilisation, call it the expression of a beast.</p><p>The leading idea of Walt Whitman's poems is as old as the hills. It is the doctrine of universal sympathy which the first poet maintained, and which the last on earth will maintain also. He says:</p><p>Not a mutineer walks handcuffed to the jail but I am hand-<br>cuffed to him and walk by his side,<br>Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the<br>last gasp.</p><p>To show this sympathy he instances a thousand paltry, frivolous, and obscene circumstances. Herein we may behold the difference between a great and a contemptible poet. What Shakspere—mighty shade of the mightiest bard, forgive us the comparison —expressed in a single line,</p><p>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,</p><p>this Walt Whitman has tortured into scores of pages. A single extract will show what we mean.

Is it not more reasonable to suppose that Walt Whitman has been learning to write, and that the compositor has got hold of his copy-book? The American critics are, in the main, pleased with this man because he is self-reliant, and because he assumes all the attributes of his country. If Walt Whitman has really assumed those attributes, America should hasten to repudiate them, be they what they may. The critics are pleased also because he talks like a man unaware that there was ever such a production as a book, or ever such a being as a writer. This in the present day is a qualification exceedingly rare, and may be valuable, so we wish those gentlemen joy of their GREAT UNTAMED.</p><p>We must not neglect to quote an unusual passage, which may be suggestive to writers of the Old World. To silence our incredulous readers, we assure them that the passage may be found at page 92:—</p><p>Is it wonderful that I should be immortal?<br>As every one is immortal, I know it is wonderful; but<br>my eyesight is equally wonderful, and how I was<br>conceived in my mother's womb is equally wonderful.<br>And how I was not palpable once but am now, and was born<br>on the last day of May 1819, and passed from a babe<br>in the creeping trance of three summers and three<br>winters to articulate and walk, are all equally wonderful.<br>And that I grew six feet high, and that I have become a<br>man thirty-six years old in 1855, and that I am here<br>anyhow,are all equally wonderful.</p><p>The transformation and the ethereal nature of Walt Whitman is marvellous to us, but perhaps not so to a nation from which the spirit-rappers sprung.</p><p>I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway<br>I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags;<br>I bequeath myself to the dirt, to grow from the grass love.<br>If you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles.</p><p>Here is also a sample of the man's slang and vulgarity:</p><p>This hour I tell things in confidence,<br>I might not tell everybody but I will tell you.<br>Who goes there! hankering, gross, mystical, nude?<br>How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?<br>What is a man anyhow?

Emerson has praised it, and called it the 'most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has yet contributed.' Because Emerson has grasped substantial fame, he can afford to be generous; but Emerson's generosity must not be mistaken for justice. If this work is really a work of genius—if the principles of those poems, their free language, their amazing and audacious egotism, their animal vigour, be real poetry and the divinest evidence of the true poet—then our studies have been in vain, and vainer still the homage which we have paid the monarchs of Saxon intellect, Shakspere, and Milton, and Byron. This Walt Whitman holds that his claim to be a poet lies in his robust and rude health. He is, in fact, as he declares, 'the poet of the body.' Adopt this theory, and Walt Whitman is a Titan; Shelley and Keats the merest pigmies. If we had commenced a notice of Leaves of Grass in anger, we could not but dismiss it in grief, for its author, we have just discovered, is conscious of his affliction. He says, at page 33,</p><p>I am given up by traitors;<br>I talk wildly, I am mad.</p><p>Well baptized: fresh, hardy, and grown for the masses. Not more welcome is their natural type to the winter-bound,bed-ridden, and spring-emancipated invalid. 'Leaves of Grass' thou art unspeakably delicious,after the forced, stiff, Parnassian exotics for which our admiration has been vainly challenged.</p><p>Walt Whitman, the effeminate world needed thee. The timidest soul whose wings ever drooped with discouragement, could not choose but rise on thy strong pinions.</p><p>'Undrape—you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor<br>discarded;<br>I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether <br>or no.'</p><p>*****</p><p>'O despairer, here is my neck,<br>You shall not go down! Hang your whole weight <br>upon me.'</p><p>Walt Whitman, the world needed a 'Native American' of thorough, out and out breed—enamored of women not ladies, men not gentlemen; something beside a mere Catholic-hating Know-Nothing; it needed a man who dared speak out his strong, honest thoughts, in the face of pusillanimous, toadeying, republican aristocracy; dictionary-men, hypocrites, cliques and creeds; it needed a large-hearted, untainted,self-reliant, fearless son of the Stars and Stripes, who disdains to sell his birthright for a mess of pottage; who does</p><p>'Not call one greater or one smaller,<br>That which fills its period and place being equal to <br>any;'</p><p>who will</p><p>'Accept nothing which all cannot have their coun- <br>terpart of on the same terms.'</p><p>Fresh 'Leaves of Grass!' not submitted by the self-reliant author to the fingering of any publisher's critic, to be arranged, rearranged and disarranged to his circumscribed liking, till they hung limp, tame, spiritless, and scentless. No. It were a spectacle worth seeing, this glorious Native American, who, when the daily labor of chisel and plane was over, him-self, with toil-hardened fingers, handled the types to print the pages which wise and good men have since delighted to endorse and to honor. Small critics, whose contracted vision could see no beauty, strength, or grace, in these 'Leaves,' have long ago repented that they so hastily wrote themselves down shallow by such a premature confession. Where an Emerson, and a Howitt have commended, my woman's voice of praise may not avail; but happiness was born a twin, and so I would fain share with others the unmingled delight which these 'Leaves' have given me.</p><p>I say unmingled; I am not unaware that the charge of coarseness and sensuality has been affixed to them. My moral constitution may be hopelessly tainted or—too sound to be tainted, as the critic wills, but I confess that I extract no poison from these Leaves—to me they have brought only healing. Let him who can do so, shroud the eyes of the nursing babe lest it should see its mother's breast. Let him look carefully between the gilded covers of books, backed by high-sounding names, and endorsed by parson and priest, lying unrebuked upon his own family table; where the asp of sensuality lies coiled amid rhetorical flowers. Let him examine well the paper dropped weekly at his door, in which virtue and religion are rendered disgusting, save when they walk in satin slippers, or, clothed in purple and fine linen, kneel on a damask 'prie-dieu.'</p><p>Sensual!—No—the moral assassin looks you not boldly in the eye by broad daylight; but Borgia-like2 takes you treacherously by the hand, while from the glittering ring on his finger he distils through your veins the subtle and deadly poison.</p><p>Sensual? The artist who would inflame, paints you not nude Nature, but stealing Virtue's veil, with artful artlessness now conceals, now exposes, the ripe and swelling proportions.</p><p>Sensual? Let him who would affix this stigma upon Leaves of Grass, write upon his heart, in letters of fire, these noble words of its author:</p><p>'In woman I see the bearer of the great fruit, which <br>is immortality **** the good thereof is not <br>tasted by roues, and never can be.</p><p>*****</p><p>Who degrades or defiles the living human body is <br>cursed,<br>Who degrades or defiles the body of the dead is not <br>more cursed.'<br>Were I an artist I would like no more suggestive subjects for my easel than Walt Whitman's pen has furnished.</p><p>'The little one sleeps in its cradle,<br>I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently <br>brush away flies with my hand.<br>The farmer stops by the bars of a Sunday and looks <br>at the oats and rye.</p><p>*****</p><p>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed Sunset,<br>Earth of the mountain's misty topt!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tin-<br>ged with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the <br>river!,<br>Earth of the limpid grey of clouds brighter and <br>clearer for my sake!<br>Far swooping elbowed earth!

London: Horsell.)</p><p>—'Latter-day poetry' in America is of a very different character from the same manifestation in the old country. Here, it is occupied for the most part with dreams of the middle ages, of the old knightly and religious times: in America, it is employed chiefly with the present, except when it travels out into the undiscovered future. Here, our latter-day poets are apt to whine over the times, as if Heaven were perpetually betraying the earth with a show of progress that is in fact retrogression, like the backward advance of crabs: there, the minstrels of the stars and stripes blow a loud note of exultation before the grand new epoch, and think the Greeks and Romans, the early Oriental races, and the later men of the middle centuries, of small account before the onward tramping of these present generations. Of this latter sect is a certain phenomenon who has recently started up in Brooklyn, New York—one Walt Whitman, author of Leaves of Grass, who has been received by a section of his countrymen as a sort of prophet, and by Englishmen as a kind of fool. For ourselves, we are not disposed to accept him as the one, having less faith in latter-day prophets than in latter-day poets; but assuredly we cannot regard him as the other. Walt is one of the most amazing, one of the most startling, one of the most perplexing, creations of the modern American mind; but he is no fool, though abundantly eccentric, nor is his book mere food for laughter, though undoubtedly containing much that may most easily and fairly be turned into ridicule.</p><p>The singularity of the author's mind—his utter disregard of ordinary forms and modes—appears in the very title-page and frontispiece of his work. Not only is there no author's name (which in itself would not be singular), but there is no publisher's name—that of the English bookseller being a London addition. Fronting the title is the portrait of a bearded gentleman in his shirt-sleeves and a Spanish hat, with an all-pervading atmosphere of Yankee-doodle about him; but again there is no patronymic, and we can only infer that this roystering blade is the author of the book. Then follows a long prose treatise by way of Preface (and here once more the anonymous system is carried out, the treatise having no heading whatever); and after that we have the poem, in the course of which, a short autobiographical discourse reveals to us the name of the author.</p><p>A passage from the Preface, if it may be so called, will give some insight into the character and objects of the work. The dots do not indicate any abbreviation by us, but are part of the author's singular system of punctuation:—</p><p><em>Other states indicate themselves in their deputies…but the genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors…but always most in the common people. Their manners speech dress friendships—the freshness and candour of their physiognomy—the picturesque looseness of their carriage…their deathless attachment to freedom—their aversion to anything indecorous, or soft, or mean—the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of one state by the citizens of all other states—the fierceness of their roused resentment—their curiosity and welcome of novelty—their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy—their susceptibility to a slight—the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors—the fluency of their speech—their delight in music, the sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance of soul…their good temper and open-handedness—the terrible significance of their elections—the President's taking off his hat to them not they to him—these too are unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of it.</em></p><p>This 'gigantic and generous treatment,' we presume, is offered in the pages which ensue. The poem is written in wild, irregular, unrhymed, almost unmetrical 'lengths,' like the measured prose of Mr. Martin Farquhar Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy, or of some of the Oriental writings. The external form, therefore, is startling, and by no means seductive, to English ears, accustomed to the sumptuous music of ordinary metres; and the central principle of the poem is equally staggering. It seems to resolve itself into an all-attracting egotism—an eternal presence of the individual soul of Walt Whitman in all things, yet in such wise that this one soul shall be presented as a type of all human souls whatsoever. He goes forth into the world, this rough, devil-may-care Yankee; passionately identifies himself with all forms of being, sentient or inanimate; sympathizes deeply with humanity; riots with a kind of Bacchanal fury in the force and fervour of his own sensations; will not have the most vicious or abandoned shut out from final comfort and reconciliation; is delighted with Broadway, New York, and equally in love with the desolate backwoods, and the long stretch of the uninhabited prairie, where the wild beasts wallow in the reeds, and the wilder birds start upwards from their nests among the grass; perceives a divine mystery wherever his feet conduct or his thoughts transport him; and beholds all beings tending towards the central and sovereign Me. Such, as we conceive, is the key to this strange, grotesque, and bewildering book; yet we are far from saying that the key will unlock all the quirks and oddities of the volume. Much remains of which we confess we can make nothing; much that seems to us purely fantastical and preposterous; much that appears to our muddy vision gratuitously prosaic, needlessly plain-speaking, disgusting without purpose, and singular without result. There are so many evidences of a noble soul in Whitman's pages that we regret these aberrations, which only have the effect of discrediting what is genuine by the show of something false; and especially do we deplore the unnecessary openness with which Walt reveals to us matters which ought rather to remain in a sacred silence. It is good not to be ashamed of Nature; it is good to have an all-inclusive charity; but it is also good, sometimes, to leave the veil across the Temple.</p><p>That the reader may be made acquainted with the vividness with which Walt can paint the unhackneyed scenery of his native land, we subjoin a panorama:—</p><p>By the city's quadrangular houses . . . in log-huts, or camping with lumber-men,<br>Along the ruts of the turnpike . . . along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,<br>Hoeing my onion-patch, and rows of carrots and parsnips . . . crossing savannas . . <br>trailing in forests,<br>Prospecting . . . gold-digging . . . girdling the trees of a new purchase,<br>Scorched ankle-deep by the hot sand . . . hauling my boat down the shallow river;<br>Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead . . . where the buck turns <br>furiously at the hunter,<br>Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock . . . where the otter is feed-<br>ing on fish,<br>Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,<br>Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey . . . where the beaver pats the <br>mud with his paddle-tail;<br>Over the growing sugar . . . over the cotton plant . . . over the rice in its low, <br>moist field;<br>Over the sharp-peaked farmhouse with its scalloped scum and slender shoots from the <br>gutters;<br>Over the western persimmon . . . over the long-leaved corn and the delicate blue<br> flowered flax;<br>Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and a buzzer there with the rest,<br>Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;<br>Scaling mountains . . . pulling myself cautiously up . . . holding on by low <br>scragged limbs,<br>Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush;<br>Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheatlot,<br>Where the bat flies in the July eve . . . where the great goldbug drops through the <br>dark;<br>Where the flails keep time on the barn floor,<br>Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow,<br>Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides,<br>Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, and andirons straddle the hearth-slab, <br>and cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;<br>Where triphammers crash . . . where the press is whirling its cylinders;<br>Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes out of its ribs.</p><p>Bothwell: A Poem in six parts By W. Edmonstoune Aytoun, D. C. L., Author of 'Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers, &c,'1 W. Blackwood and Sons. Edinburgh and London, 1856.</p><p>Leaves of Grass Brooklyn, New York, 1855.</p><p>In the works named above we have two not unmete representatives of the extremes of the Old and of the New World poetic ideal: 'Bothwell,' the product of the severely critical, refined, and ultra-conservative author of the Lays of the 'Scottish Cavaliers;' and 'Leaves of Grass,' the wild, exuberant, lawless offspring of Walt Whitman, a Brooklyn Boy, 'One of the Roughs!'</p><p>In contrast with this we have named the effusions of the Brooklyn Bard. If the accredited author of 'Firmilian' has now shown us what a poem ought to be, assuredly Walt Whitman is wide of the mark. Externally and internally he sets all law, decorum, prosody and propriety at defiance. A tall, lean, sallow, most republican, and Yankee-looking volume, is his 'Leaves of grass; full of egotism, extravagance, and spasmodic eccentricities of all sorts; and heralded by a sheaf of double-columned extracts from Reviews—not always the least curious of its singular contents. Here, for example, is a protest against the intrusion of the British muse on the free soil of the States of the Union, which must surely satisfy the most clamant demand for native poetics and republican egotism:</p><p>'What very properly fits a subject of the British crown, may fit very ill an American freeman. No fine romance, no inimitable delineation of character, no grace of delicate illustrations, no rare picture of shore or mountain or sky, no deep thought of the intellect, is so important to a man as his opinion of himself is; everything receives its tinge from that. In the verse of all those undoubtedly great writers, Shakespeare, just as much as the rest, there is the air which to America is the air of death. The mass of the people, the laborers and all who serve, are slag, refuse. The countenances of kings and great lords are beautiful; the countenances of mechanics are ridiculous and deformed. What play of Shakespeare represented in America, is not an insult to America, to the marrow in its bones? How can the tone—never silent in their plots and characters—be applauded, unless Washington should have been caught and hung, and Jefferson was the most enormous of liars, and common persons, North and South, should bow low to their betters, and to organic superiority of blood? Sure as the heavens envelop the earth, if the Americans want a race of bards worthy of 1855, and of the stern reality of this republic, they must cast around for men essentially different from the old poets, and from the modern successions of jinglers and snivellers and fops.'</p><p>—and here accordingly is something essentially different from all poets, both old and new.</p><p>The poet, unnamed on his title page, figures on his frontispiece, and unmistakeably utters his own poem:</p><p>'I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume, you shall assume;<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.<br>I loafe, and invite my soul;<br>I lean and loafe at my ease—<br>Observing a spear of Summer grass.'</p><p>Such is the starting point of this most eccentric and republican of poets; of whom the republican critic above quoted, after contrasting with him Tennyson, as 'The bard of ennui, and the aristocracy and their combination into love, the old stock love of playwrights and romancers, Shakespeare, the same as the rest.'—concludes by confessing his inability to decide whether Walt Whitman is 'to prove the most lamentable of failures, or the most glorious of triumphs, in the known history of literature.'</p><p>Assuredly, the Brooklyn poet is no commonplace writer. That he is startling and outré, no one who opens his volume will doubt. The conventionalities, and proprieties, and modesties, of thought, as well as of language, hold him in no restraint; and hence he has a vantage ground from which he may claim such credit as its licence deserves. But, apart from this, there are unmistakeable freshness, originality, and true poetic gleams of thought, mingled with the strange incoherencies of his boastful rhapsody. To call his 'Leaves' poems, would be a mistake; they resemble rather the poet's first jottings, out of which the poem is to be formed; the ore out of which the metal is to be smelted; and, in its present form, with more of dross than sterling metal in the mass.</p><p>To find an extractable passage is no easy task. Here a fine suggestive fancy ends in some offensive pruriency; there it dwindles into incomprehensible aggregations of words and terms, which—unless Machiavelli was right in teaching that words were given us to conceal our thoughts,—are mere clotted nonsense! Were we disposed to ridicule: our selections would be easy enough; or gravely to censure: abundant justification is at hand. We rather cull—not without needful omissions—the thoughts that seem to have suggested the quaint title of 'Leaves of Grass'.</p><p>'Loafe with me on the grass…loose the stop from your throat,<br>Not words, not music or rhyme I want: not custom or lecture, not even the best,<br>Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>I know that the hand of God is the elderhand of my own,<br>And I know that the spirit of God is the eldest brother of my own,<br>And that all the men ever born are also my brothers…and the women <br>my sisters and lovers,<br>And that a kelson of the Creation is love;<br>And limitless are leaves, stiff or drooping in the fields.<br>A child said, what is the Grass? fetching it to me with full hands;<br>How could I answer the child?…I do not know what it is any more than he.<br>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green <br>stuff woven.<br>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,<br>Bearing the owner's name some way in the corners, that we may see and <br>remark, and say Whose?<br>Or I guess the grass is itself a child…the produced babe of the vegetation.<br>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>And it means, Sprouting, alike in broad zones and narrow zones,<br>Growing among black folks as among white,<br>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressmen, Cuff,<br>I give them the same, I receive them the same.<br>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>All truths wait in all things,<br>They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,<br>They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,<br>The insignificant is as big to me as any,<br>Logic and sermons never convince,<br>The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journeywork of the stars,<br>And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of <br>the wren,<br>And the tree-toad is a chef-d' uvre for the highest,<br>And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,<br>And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,<br>And the cow crunching with depressed head surpasses any statue,<br>And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.'</p><p>This passage is far from being the most characteristic of the poem, and even in it we have stopped abruptly for one line more, and…Yet this will show that the punctuation is as odd as any other feature of the work; for the whole is full of conceits which speak fully as much of coarse vain-glorious egotism as of originality of genius. Any man may be an original, whether in the fopperies of the dress he puts on himself or on his poem. We are not, therefore, disposed to rate such very high, or to reckon Walt Whitman's typographical whims any more indicative of special genius, than the shirt-sleeves and unshaven chin of his frontispiece. If they indicate any thing specially, we should infer that he is a compositor by trade, and, for all his affectations of independence, could not keep 'the shop' out of his verse. But that he sets all the ordinary rules of men and poets at defiance is visible on every page of his lank volume; and if readers judge thereby that he thinks himself wiser than all previous men and poets—we have no authority to contradict them. That some of his thoughts are far from vain or common place, however, a few gleanings may suffice to prove; culled in the form, not of detached passages but of isolated ideas—line, or fragments of lines:—</p><p>'The friendly and flowing savage…Who is he?<br>Is he waiting for civilization or past it and mastering it?'</p><p>―――</p><p>'The welcome ugly face of some beautiful soul.'</p><p>'The clock indicates the moment…but what does eternity indicate?'</p><p>―――</p><p>'Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, the vapor from the nostrils of death,<br>I know I was even there…I waited unseen and always,<br>And slept while God carried me through the lethargic mist,<br>And took my time…and took no hurt from the foetid carbon.'</p><p>―――</p><p>'See ever so far…there is limitless space outside of that,<br>Count ever so much…there is limitless time around that.<br>Our rendezvous is fitly appointed…God will be there and wait till we come.'</p><p>These doubled and quadrupled points, let us add, pertain to the original, whatever their precise significance may be. Here again is a grand idea, not altogether new; and rough in its present setting, as the native gold still buried in Californian beds of quartz and debris. Nevertheless it is full of suggestive thought, and like much else in the volume—though less than most,—only requires the hand of the artist to cut, and polish, and set, that it may gleam and sparkle with true poetic lustre:—</p><p>'A slave at auction!<br>I help the auctioneer…the sloven does not half know his business.<br>Gentlemen look on this curious creature,<br>Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for him,<br>For him the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or <br>plant,<br>For him the revolving cycles truly and steadily rolled.<br>In that head the allbaffling brain,<br>In it and below it the making of the attributes of heroes.<br>Examine these limbs, red, black or white…they are very cunning in tendon <br>and nerve;<br>They shall be stript that you may see them.<br>Exquisite senses, lifelit eyes, pluck, volition,<br>Flakes of breastmuscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good <br>sized arms and legs,<br>And wonders within there yet.<br>Within there runs his blood…the same old blood…the <br>same red running blood<br>There swells and jets his heart…There all passions and desires…all <br>reachings and aspirations:<br>Do you think they are not there because they are not expressed in parlors <br>and lecture-rooms?<br>This is not only one man…he is the father of those who shall be fathers in <br>their turns,<br>In him the start of populous states and rich republics,<br>Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.<br>How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through <br>the centuries?<br>Who might you find you have come from yourself?'</p><p>'Great is life…and real and mystical…wherever and whoever,<br>Great is death…sure as life holds all parts together, death holds all parts <br>together;<br>Sure as the stars return again after they merge in the light, death is greater <br>than life.'</p><p>Such are some of the 'Leaves of Grass,' of the Brooklyn poet who describes himself in one of them as:</p><p>'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a Kosmos!'</p><p>But if the reader—recognising true poetry in some of these,—should assume such a likeness running through the whole as pertains to the blades of Nature's Grass, we disclaim all responsibility if he find reason to revise his fancy. In the two very diverse volumes under review it seems to us that we have in the one the polish of the artist, which can accomplish so much when applied to the gem or rich ore; in the other we discern the ore, but overlaid with the valueless matrix and foul rubbish of the mine, and devoid of all the unveiling beauties of art. Viewed in such aspects these poems are characteristic of the age. From each we have striven to select what appeared most worthy of the space at command, and best calculated to present them to the reader in the most favorable point of view consistent with truth. And so we leave the reader to his own judgment, between the old-world stickler for authority, precedent, and poetical respectability, and the new-world contemner of all authorities, laws, and respectabilities whatsoever. Happily for us, all choice is not necessarily limited to these. The golden mean of poesie does not, we imagine, lie between such extremes. There are not a few left, both in England and in America, for whom old Shakspeare is still respectable enough, and poetical enough,—aye and free enough too, in spite of all the freedom which has budded and bloomed since that year 1616, when his sacred ashes were laid beneath the chancel stone whose curse still guards them from impious hands. Nevertheless we have faith in the future. We doubt not even the present. When a greater poet than Shakespeare does arrive we shall not count him an impossibility.</p><p>D.W.</p><p>We find upon our table (and shall put into the fire) a thin octavo volume, handsomely printed and bound, with the above curious title. We shall not aid in extending the sale of this intensely vulgar, nay, absolutely beastly book, by telling our readers where it may be purchased. The only review we shall attempt of it, will be to thus publicly call the attention of the grand jury to a matter that needs presentment by them, and to mildly suggest that the author should be sent to a lunatic asylum, and the mercenary publishers to the penitentiary for pandering to the prurient tastes of morbid sensualists. Ralph W. Emerson's name appears as an indorser of these (so-called) poems (?)—God save the mark! We can only account for this strange fatuity upon the supposition that the letter is a forgery, that Mr. E. has not read some passages in the book, or that he lends his name to this vile production of a vitiated nature or diseased imagination, because the author is an imitator of his style, and apes him occasionally in his transcendentalisms. Affectation is as pitiful an ambition in literature as alliteration, and never has it been more fully exhibited during the present century than in the case of Thomas Carlyle, a man with an order of intellect approaching genius, but who for a distinguishing mark to point like a finger-board to himself, left a very terse and effective style of writing to adopt a jargon filled with new-fangled phrases and ungrammatical super-superlative adjectives—Mr. Carlyle buried himself for a long time in German universities and German philosophy, and came forth clothed in a full 'old clothes' suit of transcendentalism worthy of the Chatham street embodiments of that pseudo-philosophy, Kant and Spinosa [sic]—Carlyle by this operation became a full-fledged Psyche from the chrysalis, and sported in the sunshine of popularity, whereupon a young gentleman ambitious of making New England an umbra of Scottish-Germanic glory, one Ralph Waldo Emerson, suddenly transforms himself into a metaphysical transcendentalist and begins talking about 'Objective and Subjective,' the 'Inner and Outer,' the 'Real and Ideal,' the 'God-heads and God-tails,' 'Planes,' 'Spheres,' 'Finite, Infinite,' 'Unities,' and 'Dualities,' 'Squills, Ipecac,' 'Cascading and Cavorting,' &, & And lo! another appeared after this Mr. Emerson, one Walt Whitman, who kicked over the whole bucket of the Milky Way, and deluged the world with the whey, curds and bonny-clabber of Brooklyn—which has resulted from the turning of the milk of human kindness in a 'b'hoy's' brains to the cream of Tartar—and a delicious dish of the same is now furnished under cover of Leaves of Grass, and indorsed by the said Emerson, who swallows down Whitman's vulgarity and beastliness as if they were curds and whey. No wonder the Boston female schools are demoralized when Emerson, the head of the moral and solid people of Boston, indorses Whitman, and thus drags his slimy work into the sanctum of New England firesides.</p><p>Leaves of Grass Brooklyn, N.Y. 1855. 4to. pp. 95.</p><p>Leaves of Grass Brooklyn, N.Y. 1856. 16mo. pp. 384.</p><p>So, then, these rank Leaves have sprouted afresh, and in still greater abundance. We hoped that they had dropped, and we should hear no more of them. But since they thrust themselves upon us again, with a pertinacity that is proverbial of noxious weeds, and since these thirty- two poems (!) threaten to become 'several hundred,—perhaps a thousand,'—we can no longer refrain from speaking of them as we think they deserve. For here is not a question of literary opinion principally, but of the very essence of religion and morality. The book might pass for merely hectoring and ludicrous, if it were not something a great deal more offensive. We are bound in conscience to call it impious and obscene. Punch 1 made sarcastic allusion to it some time ago, as a specimen of American literature. We regard it as one of its worst disgraces. Whether or not the author really bears the name he assumes,—whether or not the strange figure opposite the title-page resembles him, or is even intended for his likeness—whether or not he is considered among his friends to be of a sane mind,—whether he is in earnest, or only playing off some disgusting burlesque,—we are hardly sure yet. We know only, that, in point of style, the book is an impertinence towards the English language; and in point of sentiment, an affront upon the recognized morality of respectable people. Both its language and thought seem to have just broken out of Bedlam. It sets off upon a sort of distracted philosophy, and openly deifies the bodily organs, senses, and appetites, in terms that admit of no double sense. To its pantheism and libidinousness it adds the most ridiculous swell of self-applause; for the author is 'one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshy, sensual, divine inside and out. This head more than churches or bibles or creeds. The scent of these arm-pits an aroma finer than prayer. If I worship any particular thing, it shall be some of the spread of my body.' He leaves 'washes and razors for foofoos;' thinks the talk 'about virtue and about vice' only 'blurt,' he being above and indifferent to both of them; and he himself, 'speaking the pass-word primeval, By God! will accept nothing which all cannot have the counterpart of on the same terms.' These quotations are made with cautious delicacy. We pick our way as cleanly as we can between other passages which are more detestable.</p><p>A friend whispers as we write, that there is nevertheless a vein of benevolence running through all this vagabondism and riot. Yes; there is plenty of that philanthropy, which cares as little for social rights as for the laws of God. This Titan in his own esteem is perfectly willing that all the rest of the world should be as frantic as himself. In fact, he has no objection to any persons whatever, unless they wear good clothes, or keep themselves tidy. Perhaps it is not judicious to call any attention to such a prodigious impudence. Dante's guide through the infernal regions bade him, on one occasion, Look and pass on. It would be a still better direction sometimes, when in neighborhoods of defilement and death, to pass on without looking. Indeed, we should even now hardly be tempted to make the slightest allusion to this crazy outbreak of conceit and vulgarity, if a sister Review had not praised it, and even undertaken to set up a plea in apology for its indecencies. We must be allowed to say, that it is not good to confound the blots upon great compositions with the compositions that are nothing but a blot. It is not good to confound the occasional ebullitions of too loose a fancy or too wanton a wit, with a profession and 'illustrated' doctrine of licentiousness. And furthermore, it is specially desirable to be able to discern the difference between the nudity of a statue and the gestures of a satyr; between the plain language of a simple state of society, and the lewd talk of the opposite state, which a worse than heathen lawlessness has corrupted; between the 'ευνηκαιφιλότητι,' or 'φιλότητικαιευνημιγη ναι' of the Iliad and Odyssey, and an ithyphallic audacity that insults what is most sacred and decent among men.</p><p>There is one feature connected with the second edition of this foul work to which we cannot feel that we do otherwise than right in making a marked reference, because it involves the grossest violation of literary comity and courtesy that ever passed under our notice. Mr. Emerson had written a letter of greeting to the author on the perusal of the first edition, the warmth and eulogium of which amaze us. But 'Walt Whitman' has taken the most emphatic sentence of praise from this letter, and had it stamped in gold, signed 'R. W. Emerson,' upon the back of his second edition. This second edition contains some additional pieces, which in their loathsomeness exceed any of the contents of the first. Thus the honored name of Emerson, which has never before been associated with anything save refinement and delicacy in speech and writing, is made to indorse a work that teems with abominations.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS— FOWLER & WELLS: New-York.</p><p>What Centaur have we here, half man, half beast, neighing shrill defiance to all the world? What conglomerate of thought is this before us, with insolence, philosophy, tenderness, blasphemy, beauty and gross indecency tumbling in drunken confusion through the pages? Who is this arrogant young man who proclaims himself the Poet of the Time, and who roots like a pig among a rotten garbage of licentious thoughts? Who is this flushed and full-blooded lover of Nature who studies her so affectionately, and who sometimes utters her teachings with a lofty tongue? This mass of extraordinary contradictions, this fool and this wise man, this lover of beauty and this sunken sensualist, this original thinker and blind egotist, is Mr. WALT. WHITMAN, author of Leaves of Grass, and, according to his own account, 'a Kosmos.'</p><p>Some time since there was left at the office of this paper a thin quarto volume bound in green and gold. On opening the book we first beheld, as a frontispiece, the picture of a man in his shirt sleeves, wearing an expression of settled arrogance upon his countenance. We next arrived at a title page of magnificent proportions, with letter-press at least an inch and a half in length. From this title page we learned that the book was entitled Leaves of Grass, and was printed at Brooklyn in the year 1855. This inspected, we passed on to what seemed to be a sort of preface, only that it had no beginning, was remarkable for a singular sparseness in the punctuation, and was broken up in a confusing manner by frequent rows of dots separating the paragraphs. To this succeeded eighty-two pages of what appeared at the first glance to be a number of prose sentences printed somewhat after a biblical fashion. Almost at the first page we opened we lighted upon the confession that the author was</p><p>'WALT. WHITMAN, an American, one of the roughs, <br>a Kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy and sensual . . . . '</p><p>This was sufficient basis for a theory. We accordingly arrived at the conclusion that the insolent-looking young man on the frontispiece was this same WALT. WHITMAN, and author of the Leaves of Grass.</p><p>Then returning to the fore-part of the book, we found proof slips of certain review articles about the Leaves of Grass. One of these purported to be extracted from a periodical entitled the United States Review, the other was headed 'From the American Phrenological Journal.' These were accompanied by a printed copy of an extravagant letter of praise addressed by Mr. RALPH WALDO EMERSON to Mr. WALT. WHITMAN, complimenting him on the benefaction conferred on society in the present volume. On subsequently comparing the critiques from the United States Review and the Phrenological Journal with the preface of the Leaves of Grass, we discovered unmistakable internal evidence that Mr. Walt Whitman, true to his character, of a Kosmos, was not content with writing a book, but was also determined to review it; so Mr. WALT. WHITMAN, had concocted both those criticisms of his own work, treating it we need not say how favorably. This little discovery of our 'disorderly' acquaintance's mode of proceeding rather damped any enthusiasm with which Mr. EMERSON's exravagant letter may have inspired us. We reflected, here is a man who sets himself up as the poet and teacher of his time; who professes a scorn of everything mean and dastardly and double-faced, who hisses with scorn as he passes one in the street whom he suspects of the taint, hypocrisy - yet this self-contained teacher, this rough-and-ready scorner of dishonesty, this rowdy knight-errant who tilts against all lies and shams, himself perpetrates a lie and a sham at the very outset of his career. It is a lie to write a review of one's own book, then extract it from the work in which it appeared and send it out to the world as an impartial editorial utterance. It is an act that the most degraded helot of literature might blush to commit. It is a dishonesty committed against one's own nature, and all the world. Mr. WALT. WHITMAN in one of his candid rhapsodies announces that he is 'no more modest than immodest.' Perhaps in literary matters he carries the theory farther, and is no more honest than dishonest. He likewise says in his preface: 'The great poets are known by the absence in them of tricks, and by the justification of perfect personal candor.' Where, then, can we place Mr. WALT. WHITMAN's claims upon immortality?</p><p>We confess we turn from Mr. WHITMAN as Critic, to Mr. WHITMAN as Poet, with considerable pleasure. We prefer occupying that independent position which Mr. WHITMAN claims for man, and forming our own opinions, rather than swallowing those ready-made. This gentleman begins his poetic life with a coarse and bitter scorn of the past. We have been living stale and unprofitable lives; we have been surfeited with luxury and high living, and are grown lethargic and dull; the age is fast decaying, when, lo! the trump of the Angel Whitman brings the dead to life, and animates the slumbering world. If we obey the dictates of that trumpet, we will do many strange things. We will fling off all moral clothing and walk naked over the earth. We will disembarrass our language of all the proprieties of speech, and talk indecency broadcast. We will act in short as if the Millennium were arrived in this our present day, when the absence of all vice would no longer necessitate a virtuous discretion. We fear much, Mr. WALT. WHITMAN, that the time is not yet come for the nakedness of purity. We are not yet virtuous enough to be able to read your poetry aloud to our children and our wives. What might be pastoral simplicity five hundred years hence, would perhaps be stigmatized as the coarsest indecency now, and - we regret to think that you have spoken too soon.</p><p>The adoration of the 'Me,' the 'Ego,' the 'eternal and universal I,' to use the jargon of the Boston Oracle, is the prevailing motive of Leaves of Grass. Man embraces and comprehends the whole. He is everything, and everything is him. All nature ebbs and flows through him in ceaseless tides. He is 'his own God and his own Devil,' and everything that he does is good. He rejoices with all who rejoice; suffers with all who suffer. This doctrine is exemplified in the book by a panorama as it were of pictures, each of which is shared in by the author, who belongs to the universe, as the universe belongs to him. In detailing these pictures he hangs here and there shreds and tassels of his wild philosophy, till his work, like a maniac's robe, is bedizened with fluttering tags of a thousand colors. With all his follies, insolence, and indecency, no modern poet that we know of has presented finer descriptive passages than Mr. WALT. WHITMAN. His phrasing, and the strength and completeness of his epithets, are truly wonderful. He paints in a single line with marvellous power and comprehensiveness. The following rhapsody will illustrate his fulness of epithet:</p><p>'I am he that walks with the tender and growing <br>night;<br>I call to the earth and sea, half held by the night.</p><p>'Press close bare-bosomed night! Press close mag-<br>netic, nourishing night!<br>Night of South winds! Night of the large few stars!<br>Still nodding night! Mad, naked, Summer night!</p><p>'Smile, O voluptuous cool-breathed earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset! Earth of the mountains <br>misty-topt!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just <br>tinged with blue! <br>Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the <br>river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and <br>clearer for my sake!<br>Far-swooping elbowed earth! Rich apple-blossomed <br>earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes!</p><p>'You sea! I resign myself to you also…I guess <br>what you mean.<br>I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fin-<br> gers,<br>I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me;<br>We must have a turn together…I undress…hurry <br>me out of sight of the land.<br>Cushion me soft…rock me in billowy drowse,<br>Dash me with amorous wet…I can repay you.'</p><p>'Sea of stretched ground-swells!<br>Sea, breathing broad and convulsive breaths!<br>Sea of the brine of life! Sea of unshovelled and al- <br>ways-ready graves!<br>Howler and scooper of storms! Capricious and dainty <br>sea!<br>I am integral with you…I too am of one phase and <br>of all phases.'</p><p>Here are fine expressions well placed. Mr. WHITMAN's study of nature has been close and intense. He has expressed certain things better than any other man who has gone before him. He talks well, and largely, and tenderly of sea and sky, and men and trees, and women and children. His observation and his imagination are both large and well-developed. Take this picture; how pathetic, how tenderly touched!</p><p>'Agonies are one of my changes of garments;<br>I do not ask the wounded person how he feels…I <br>myself become the wounded person,<br>My hurt turns livid upon me as I lean on a cane and <br>observe.<br>I am the mashed fireman with breast-bone broken… <br>trembling walls buried me in their debris.<br>Heat and smoke I inspired…I heard the yelling <br>shouts of my comrades,<br>I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels;<br>They have cleared the beams away…they tenderly <br>lift me forth.<br>I lie in the night air in my red shirt…the pervading <br>hush is for my sake,<br>Painless after all I lie, exhausted but not so unhappy.<br>White and beautiful are the faces around me…the <br>heads are bared of their fire-caps.<br>The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the <br>torches.'</p><p>If it were permitted to us to outrage all precedent, and print that which should not be printed, we could cull some passages from the 'Leaves of Grass,' and place them in strange contrast with the extracts we have already made. If being a Kosmos is to set no limits to one's imagination; to use coarse epithets when coarseness is not needful; to roam like a drunken satyr, with inflamed blood, through every field of lascivious thought; to return time after time with a seemingly exhaustless prurient pleasure to the same licentious phrases and ideas, and to jumble all this up with bits of marvellously beautiful description, exquisite touches of nature, fragments of savagely uttered truth, shreds of unleavened philosophy; if to do all this is to be a Kosmos, then indeed we cede to Mr. WALT. WHITMAN his arrogated title. Yet it seems to us that one may be profound without being beastly; one may teach philosophy without clothing it in slang; one may be a great poet without using a language which shall outlaw the minstrel from every decent hearth. Mr. WALT. WHITMAN does not think so. He tears the veil from all that society by a well-ordered law shrouds in a decent mystery. He is proud of his nakedness of speech; he glories in his savage scorn of decorum. Like the priests of Belus, he wreathes around his brow the emblems of the Phallic worship.</p><p>With all this muck of abomination soiling the pages, there is a wondrous, unaccountable fascination about the Leaves of Grass. As we read it again and again, and we will confess that we have returned to it often, a singular order seems to arise out of its chaotic verses. Out of the mire and slough edged thoughts and keen philosophy start suddenly, as the men of Cadmus sprang from the muddy loam. A lofty purpose still dominates the uncleanness and the ridiculous self-conceit in which the author, led astray by ignorance, indulges. He gives token everywhere that he is a huge uncultivated thinker. No country save this could have given birth to the man. His mind is Western—brawny, rough, and original. Wholly uncultivated, and beyond his associates, he has begotten within him the egotism of intellectual solitude. Had he mingled with scholars and men of intellect, those effete beings whom he so despises, he would have learned much that would have been beneficial. When we have none of our own size to measure ourselves with, we are apt to fancy ourselves broader and taller and stronger than we are. The poet of the little country town, who has reigned for years the Virgil or Anacreon1 of fifty square miles, finds, when he comes into the great metropolis, that he has not had all the thinking to himself. There he finds hundreds of men who have thought the same things as himself, and uttered them more fully. He is astonished to discover that his intellectual language is limited, when he thought that he had fathomed expression. He finds his verse unpolished, his structure defective, his best thoughts said before. He enters into the strife, clashes with his fellows, measures swords with this one, gives thrust for thrust with the other, until his muscles harden and his frame swells. He looks back upon his provincial intellectual existence with a smile; he laughs at his country arrogance and ignorant faith in himself. Now we gather from Mr. WHITMAN's own admissions—admissions that assume the form of boasts—that he has mingled but little with intellectual men. The love of the physical—which is the key-note of his entire book—has as yet altogether satisfied him. To mix with large-limbed, clean-skinned men, to look on ruddy, fair-proportioned women, is his highest social gratification. This love of the beautiful is by him largely and superbly expressed in many places, and it does one good to read those passages pulsating with the pure blood of animal life. But those associates, though manly and handsome, help but little to a man's inner appreciation of himself. Perhaps our author among his comrades had no equal in intellectual force. He reigned triumphantly in an unquestioning circle of admirers. How easy, then, to fancy one's self a wonderful being! How easy to look around and say, 'There are none like me here. I am the coming man!' It may be said that books will teach such a man the existence of other powerful minds, but this will not do. Such communion is abstract, and has but little force. It is only in the actual combat of mind striving with mind that a man comes properly to estimate himself. Mr. WHITMAN has grown up in an intellectual isolation which has fully developed all the eccentricities of his nature. He has made some foolish theory that to be rough is to be original. Now, external softness of manner is in no degree incompatible with muscularity of intellect; and one thinks no more of a man's brains for his treading on one's toes without an apology, or his swearing in the presence of women. When Mr. WHITMAN shall have learned that a proper worship of the individual man need not be expressed so as to seem insolence, and that men are not to be bullied into receiving as a Messiah every man who sneers at them in his portrait, and disgusts them in his writings, we have no doubt that in some chastened mood of mind he will produce moving and powerful books. We select some passages exhibiting the different phases of Mr. WHITMAN's character. We do so more readily as, from the many indecencies contained in Leaves of Grass, we do not believe it will find its way into many families.</p><p><em>A MODEST PROFESSION OF FAITH.</em></p><p>'Nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,<br>And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy, <br>walks to his own funeral,<br>Dressed in his shroud.'</p><p><em>A FINE LANDSCAPE.</em></p><p>'The turbid pool that lies in the Autumn forest,<br>The moon that descends the steeps of the soughing <br>twilight,<br>Toss, sparkles of day and dusk…toss on the black <br>stems that decay in the muck;<br>Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.'</p><p><em>A TRUTH.</em></p><p>'I, too, am not a bit tamed…I, too, am untransla- <br>table;<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.'</p><p><em>A DEATH-BED.</em></p><p>'When the dull nights are over, and the dull days <br>also;<br>When the soreness of lying so much in bed is over,<br>When the physician, after long putting off, gives the <br>silent and terrible look for an answer;<br>When the children come hurried and weeping, and the <br>brothers and sisters have been sent for;<br>When medicines stand unused on the shelf, and the <br>camphor-smell has pervaded the rooms;<br>When the faithful hand of the living does not desert <br>the hand of the dying,<br>When the twitching lips press lightly on the forehead <br>of the dying;<br>When the breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart <br>ceases;<br>Then the corpse limbs stretch on the bed, and the <br>living look upon them,<br>They are palpable as the living are palpable.<br>The living look upon the corpse with their eye-sight,<br>But without eye-sight lingers a different living and looks <br>curiously on the corpse.'</p><p><em>IMMORTALITY.</em><p><p>'If maggots and rats ended us, then suspicion, and <br>treachery and death.<br>Do you suspect death?

WHITMAN has published an enlarged edition of his works, from which it is fair to infer that his first has had a ready sale. From twelve poems, of which the original book was composed, he has brought the number up to thirty, all characterized by the same wonderful amalgamation of beauty and indecency. He has, however, been in his new edition guilty of a fresh immodesty. He has not alone printed Mr. EMERSON's private letter in an appendix, but he has absolutely printed a passage of that gentleman's note, 'I greet you at the beginning of a great career,' in gold letters on the back, and affixed the name of the writer. Now, Mr. EMERSON wrote a not very wise letter to Mr. WHITMAN on the publication of the first twelve poems—indorsing them, and so there might be some excuse for the poet's anxiety to let the public know that his first edition was commended from such a quarter. But with the additional poems, Mr. EMERSON has certainly nothing whatever to do; nevertheless, the same note that indorsed the twelve is used by Mr. WHITMAN in the coolest manner to indorse the thirty-two. This is making a private letter go very far indeed. It is as if after a man signed a deed, the person interested should introduce a number of additional clauses, making the original signature still cover them. It is a literary fraud, and Mr. WHITMAN ought to be ashamed of himself.</p><p>Still, this man has brave stuff in him. He is truly astonishing. The originality of his philosophy is of little account, for if it is truth, it must be ever the same, whether uttered by his lips or PLATO's. In manner only can we be novel, and truly Mr. WHITMAN is novelty itself. Since the greater portion of this review was written, we confess to having been attracted again and again to Leaves of Grass. It has a singular electric attraction. Its manly vigor, its brawny health, seem to incite and satisfy. We look forward with curious anticipation to Mr. WALT. WHITMAN's future works. We are much mistaken if, after all, he does not yet contribute something to American literature which shall awaken wonder.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS. Brooklyn, New York, 1856. For sale by Fowler & Wells, No. 308 Broadway.</p><p>A new edition of Walt Whitman’s wonderful poems.</p><p>Leaves of Grass was first published something more than a year ago. It then appeared in a quarto form of 89 pages, and, as we understand, was set up and printed by the author himself. The present edition is a decided improvement on the first; it contains 384 pages, 18mo., and being neatly printed is much more desirable than the quarto.</p><p>We have heretofore reviewed Walter Whitman’s poems, and spoken of them at considerable length, and spoken very highly of them, too. It is, of course, unnecessary to repeat what we have previously said, or even to enter largely into a discussion of the eccentricities of the author, or the peculiarities and the beauties of his poems. It will be sufficient to say that they have been almost universally admired by men whose authority is unquestionable, and with scarcely an exception, have been highly praised by the press of both this country and of England.</p><p>In Walt Whitman’s letter to Mr. Emerson, he writes in precisely the same style as he does in his poems. From that letter we take the following extract. It presents an idea of his manner of writing, and truthfully describes a class of persons who are exactly opposite to Walt Whitman. Here it is, and with it we close our notice:</p><p>Up to the present, as helps best, the people, like a lot of large boys, have no determined tastes, are quite unaware of the grandeur of themselves, and of their destiny, and of their immense strides—accept with voracity whatever is presented them in novels, histories, newspapers, poems, schools, lectures, every thing. Pretty soon, through these and other means, their development makes the fiber that is capable of itself, and will assume determined tastes. The young men will be clear what they want, and will have it. They will follow none except him whose spirit leads them in the like spirit with themselves. Any such man will be welcome as the flowers of May. Others will be put out without ceremony. How much is there anyhow, to the young men of these States, in a parcel of helpless dandies, who can neither fight, work, shoot, ride, run, command—some of them devout, some quite insane, some castrated—all second-hand, or third, fourth, or fifth hand—waited upon by waiters, putting not this land first, but always other lands first, talking of art, doing the most ridiculous things for fear of being called ridiculous, smirking and skipping along, continually taking off their hats—no one behaving, dressing, writing, talking, loving, out of any natural and manly tastes of his own, but each one looking cautiously to see how the rest behave, dress, write, talk, love—pressing the noses of dead books upon themselves and upon their country—favoring no poets, philosophs, literats here, but dog-like danglers at the heels of the poets, philosophs, literats, of enemies' lands—favoring mental expressions, models of gentlemen and ladies, social habitudes in These States, to grow up in sneaking defiance of the popular substratums of The States? Of course they and the likes of them can never justify the strong poems of America. Of course no feed of theirs is to stop and be made welcome to muscle the bodies, male and female, for Manhattan Island, Brooklyn, Boston, Worcester, Hartford, Portland, Montreal, Detroit, Buffalo, Cleveland, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Chicago, Cincinnati, Iowa City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Raleigh, Savannah, Charleston, Mobile, New Orleans, Galveston, Brownsville, San Francisco, Havana, and a thousand equal cities, present and to come. Of course what they and the likes of them have been used for, draws toward its close, after which they will all be discharged, and not one of them will ever be heard of any more.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS.— Brooklyn, N. Y.</p><p>This is a new, enlarged and stereotyped edition of that singular production of 'Walt Whitman,' whose first appearance in '55 created such an extraordinary sensation in the literary world on both sides of the Atlantic. The first edition—which was duly noticed in these columns—contained twelve poems. In the present edition those poems are revised, and twenty others are added. The form of the book has been changed from 4 to 16mo, and the typography is much improved.</p><p>The work, in its singular character, we understand to be an assertion of a two-fold individuality for the author: of himself personally, and of himself nationally; and the author, by example at least, to be an advocate of as much for all of his nation. A bold example he sets. The titles of the poems are various, and the poems under them present differences; yet through them all, with whatever else, runs one vital view; one ontological lesson in the same idiosyncratic strain.</p><p>Fanciful, fertile, and free in words, yet often, conventionally speaking, inelegant, and sometimes downright low; simple, abrupt, and detached sentences; frequently aphoristic, yet diffuse and uniform, sometimes to tediousness; at times strikingly clear and forcible, and again impenetrably obscure; a meeting of the extremes of literalness and metaleptic figures—of tiresome superficial details and comprehensive subtle generalities, oddities, ruggedness and strength; these are the chief characteristics of his style. There occur frequent instances of all- important and majestic thought, and so fitly expressed that the dissonance to the unaccustomed ears of the reader cannot prevent his stopping to admire. The matter is characterized by thought rather than by sentiment. The right and duty of man with the passions are enjoined and celebrated, rather than the passions themselves. There are speculative philosophies advanced, upon which readers will differ with the author and with each other; and some of these to intolerant conventionalists will give offense. We are not prepared to endorse them all ourselves. And there are practical philosophies of which he treats, destined to encounter fiercer repugnance. But the book is not one that warrants its dismissal with disgust or contempt. There is a deep substratum of observant and contemplative wisdom as broad as the foundation of society, running through it all; and whatever else there is of questionable good, so much at least is a genuine pearl that we cannot afford to trample it under our feet. The poems contain some lessons of the highest importance, and possess a further value in their strong suggestiveness. We accord to the leading idea of the work alone, personal with national individuality, exemplified and recommended as it is, an incalculable value. The poems improve upon a second reading, and they may commonly require a repetition in order to [gain] a deserved appreciation, like a strange piece of music with subtle harmonies.</p><p>The work is altogether sui generis, unless we may call it Emersonian. That name is ample enough to cover a multitude of oddities and excellencies; but that it is not shaped to all the radiations of the unbridled muse of the author under notice we think a single extract from his first poem will show:</p><p>I am the poet of the body,<br>And I am the poet of the soul.<br>The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains <br>of hell are with me,<br>The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter <br>I translate into a new tongue.<br>I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,<br>And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a <br>man,<br>And I say there is nothing greater than the mother <br>of men.<br>I chant a new chant of dilation or pride,<br>We have had ducking and deprecating about <br>enough,<br>I show that size is only developement.</p><p>Have you outstript the rest? Are you the Presi-<br> dent?<br>It is a trifle—they will more than arrive there every <br>one, and still pass on.<br>I am he that walks with the tender and growing <br>night;<br>I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.</p><p>Press close bare-bosomed night! press close mag- <br>netic, nourishing night!<br>Night of south winds! night of the large few stars!<br>Still, nodding night! mad, naked summer night!</p><p>Smile O voluptuous, cool-breathed earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset! earth of the mountains, <br>misty-topt!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon, just <br>tinged with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the <br>river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and <br>clearer for my sake!<br>Far swooping elbowed earth! rich, apple-blossomed <br>earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes!</p><p>Prodigal! you have given me love! therefore I to <br>you give love!<br>O unspeakable passionate love!</p><p>Thruster holding me tight, and that I hold tight!<br>We hurt each other as the bridegroom and the <br>bride hurt each other.</p><p>You sea! I resign myself to you also, I guess what <br>you mean,<br>I behold from the beach your crooked inviting <br>fingers,<br>I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of <br>me;<br>We must have a turn together—I undress—hurry <br>me out of sight of the land,<br>Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,<br>Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.</p><p>Sea of stretched ground-swells!<br>Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths!<br>Sea of the brine of life! sea of unshovelled and al- <br>ways-ready graves!<br>Howler and scooper of storms! capricious and dainty <br>sea!<br>I am integral with you—I too am of one phase, and <br>of all phases!</p>
