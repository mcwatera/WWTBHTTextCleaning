<p>WALT WHITMAN'S WORKS.</p><p>———</p><p>To ninety-nine out of every hundred educated English readers, if not, indeed, to a larger proportion, the name Walt Whitman conveys no meaning or associations whatever. Of the few, moreover, who have previously heard the name still fewer have had the opportunity of seeing the work to which it owes whatever celebrity it may have attained. Yet its bearer is a man of some mark in America, and his work has not only startled the few educated Englishmen who have seen it, but is undoubtedly destined to hold a prominent position in American literature. Many causes contribute to render Leaves of Grass, as Walt Whitman's principal work is called, a sealed book to English readers. The first reason is its costliness. A dozen copies would scarcely, we should suppose, reward the most diligent search that could be instituted through England, and, probably, not a quarter of that number is on sale. When met with at the establishments of the principal American bookselling agents, the price of the volume is as much as is asked for the complete works of Tennyson or Swinburne. A second reason for the scarcity of the book is that the form of its composition is not at first glance attractive, and that its contents are such as cannot possibly be admitted into family reading. Leaves of Grass, is, however, the most thoroughly national and characteristic American poem that has yet seen the light, and is a work the influence of which will yet be felt. It is a book concerning which Englishmen ought to know at least a little. For various reasons, then, among which figures prominently the difficulty in obtaining the volume, we hold we are rendering a real service to our readers in bringing under their observation a few striking features in this remarkable and most suggestive work.</p><p>We have spoken of it as national and characteristic in the fullest sense, and so it is. An Englishman might have written ninety-nine hundredths of American poetry. Scarcely a line or stanza in Longfellow, Holmes, Bryant, Whittier, that is in the fullest sense American. The philosophical poems of Emerson have a flavour of nationality, and a very strong taste thereof pervades such comic works as the Big[e]low papers, and other similar productions. But those comic works which aim at satirising the manners and customs of every-day life are necessarily the first parts of a young nation's literature, in which local colour is observable. Before the appearance of Leaves of Grass, no serious American work was wholly or in any wide sense national. The spirit that pervades Leaves of Grass is essentially American. It is more. To use a word the author is fond of, it is Manhattanese. A resident in the capital of the Empire State alone could have produced it. The rowdyism and greed of New York life, as well as its higher qualities, pervade it. Walt Whitman is as completely a New Yorkist as Charles Lamb was a Londoner or Christopher North a Scot. Not that he is uninfluenced by preceding writers of other countries. On the contrary, his work is, to some extent, an olla podrida of other people's thoughts, manners, and forms, but the main current belongs to New York. The philosophy and theology are decidedly American, the ethics are altogether of New York. We seem to trace half-a-dozen authors in Walt Whitman. The freedom and coarseness of his phraseology recal[l] Rabelais. In his most poetical passages he reminds us of Ossian. His philosophy has a flavour of Emerson; his constant display of independence and his peculiar habit of self-assertion, find no parallel save in George Wither; and his didactic breathings are in form, if in nothing else, at times suggestive of Tupper.</p><p>Leaves of Grass is a volume of nearly five hundred pages, of what the author considers and calls poetry. It is divided under several heads, the most important of which are 'Walt Whitman,' 'Chants Democratic,' 'Leaves of Grass' (which gives its title to the whole), 'Enfans d'Adam,' 'Calamus,' and 'Messenger Leaves.' All are alike in shape. Though called poems, the contents of the entire volume, one short passage in which the rhyme may be the result of accident excepted, have neither rhyme nor metre. The poems have a long rhythmic flow, which bears about the same relation to ordinary poetry that the military or mournful music of a savage tribe does to music as understood in Western Europe. The verses are of unequal length, ordinarily possessing a caesura and a strongly-marked accent on the penultimate syllable. This last quality is, however, not always observable. To quit form, however, and come to what is more important, matter, there are three pervading ideas in the volume, which may be described as the apotheosis of the flesh, the exaltation of states life, and the promotion of comradeship. To deal with these seriatim, in the first Whitman takes part in a natural and easily comprehensible reaction, signs of which have of late manifested themselves, against the extreme glorification of the soul at the expense of the body, which has been one of the results of Christianity. Heathen teaching held soul and body of equal account, and the Greek regarding each with equal reverence, was at as much pains to cultivate the powers of the one as is the other. The belief in the equality of the body with the soul largely pervades the writings of Whitman. Next to this comes his exaltation of democracy in general, and of American democracy in particular. Lastly comes the notion of comradeship. This last we only partially understand, and are not in the least tempted to enter upon. These are the views which first recal[l] themselves upon rising from the accomplished perusal of Leaves of Grass. A hundred other points, however, require mentioning ere we can profess to bring before the reader Walt Whitman as he really is. It is time, however, to give the reader a few quotations illustrative of the author's modes of thought. Fortunately, in so doing we give an insight into the nature of his verse also. We are obliged to be guarded in our selections. It is not possible to quote the passages which are in the fullest sense characteristic. Neither is it possible in the space we have allotted ourselves to give more than the feeblest conceivable idea of the nature of the contents of the remarkable book before us. Here are four lines in which the author describes himself:—</p><p>'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos.<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, breeding,<br>No sentimentalist—no stander above men and women, or apart <br>from men,<br>No more modest than immodest.'</p><p>He continues with wonderful worship of himself in lines from which we extract almost at random:—</p><p>'I dote on myself—there is that lot of me, and all so luscious,<br>Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with delight.<br>O, I am so wonderful!<br>I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the causes of my <br>faintest wish,<br>Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, not the cause of the friend-<br>ship I take again.<br>That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be.<br>That I eat and drink is spectacle enough for the great authors <br>and school.<br>A morning glory at my window satisfies me more than the meta-<br>physics of books.'</p><p>His general views may be gathered from one or two passage selected as illustrative of different phases of mind:—</p><p>'I play not here marches for victors only; I play great marches <br>for conquered and slain persons.<br>Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?<br>I also say that it is good to fall—battles are lost in the same spirit in <br>which they are won.<br>I beat triumphal drums for the dead.<br>I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest music to <br>them.<br>Vivas to those who have failed.<br>And to those whose war vessels sunk in the sea;<br>And those themselves who sank in the sea;<br>And to all generals that have lost engagements; and all over-<br>come heroes;<br>And the numberless unknown heroes, equal to the greatest heroes <br>known.'</p><p>His transcendentalism finds vent in the lines in which, after praising the discoveries of Positive science and singing hurra for all exact demonstrators, he continues:—</p><p>'Gentlemen, I receive you and attach and clasp hands with <br>you.<br>The facts are useful and real—they are not my dwelling—I enter <br>by them to an area of the dwelling.'</p><p>His theology is continually obtruded:—</p><p>'I do not despise you priests.<br>My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,<br>Enclosing all worship, ancient and modern, and all between <br>ancient and modern.'</p><p>Or again:—</p><p>'And I call to mankind, be not curious about God,<br>For I, who am curious about each, am not curious about God.<br>No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God <br>and about death.<br>I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not <br>in the least.<br>Why should I wish to see God better than this day?<br>I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each <br>moment then.<br>In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face<br> in the glass.<br>I find letters from God dropped in the street, and every one is <br>signed by God's name.<br>And I leave them where they are, for I know that they will punc-<br>tually come for ever and ever.<br>And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to <br>try to alarm me.'</p><p>Again:—</p><p>'I do not understand the realities of death, but I know they are <br>great.<br>I do not understand the least reality of life; how, then, can I un-<br>derstand the realities of death?'</p><p>The 'Chants Democratic' exalt everything American, the attributes of people and country alike, and are full of truly American exaggeration. They are far less interesting to English readers than the other portions of the volume. Everything American is the subject of his praises:—</p><p>'These states are the amplest poem.<br>Here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations.<br>Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of <br>the day and night.<br>Here is what moves in magnificent masses—carelessly faithful <br>of particulars.<br>Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the <br>soul loves,'<br>Here the flowing trains—here the crowds, equality, diversity, the <br>soul loves.'</p><p>He sings the American wherever he is found:—</p><p>'Cutters down of wood and haulers of it to the Penobscot or <br>Kennebec,<br>Dwellers in cabins among the California mountains or by the <br>little lakes or on the Columbia.<br>Dwellers south on the banks of the Gila or Rio Grande—friendly <br>gatherings, the characters and fun,<br>Dwellers up north in Minnesota and by the Yellow Stone River— <br>dwellers on coasts and off coasts, etc'</p><p>But we can extract no more. Our space forbids, and, inadequately as our task is accomplished, we must retire from it. Our readers have seen enough of the book to have an idea of it and the author. To know all his talent and eccentricity is impossible till the book itself has been perused. The contents of the volume can by a stretch only be called poetry. They lack its first and most indispensable element, beauty. They are, however, strange and most suggestive reading, and such as a man of culture will not care entirely to ignore. Spite of barbarous expressions, vile Americanisms, and all faults of thought and expression, the writings of Walt Whitman are full of character, and well worthy of contemplation. They will in time attain a certain measure of celebrity even, and their author is surely entitled to a distinct niche in American literature. With this short notice we dismiss him as he dismisses himself—</p><p>'I bequeath myself to the dirt, to grow from the grass I love,<br>If you want me again look for me under your boot soles.'</p><p>Meantime, we hope, we have brought him before the reader as he stands—</p><p>'Sounding his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.'</p><p>WALT WHITMAN.</p><p>So far as the title-page of the well-printed volume before us furnishes any information, it is written by and published by New York, and doubtless such is the case. We understand it to be a collection of Walt Whitman's previous works, 'Leaves of Grass,' and 'Drum-taps,' with the addition of a work containing much that has not been before printed, entitled 'Songs before Parting.' A careful perusal of these remarkable productions has convinced us that the vague impression we have now and then encountered that Walt Whitman is a kind of 'learned pig' is far from correct; we cannot pretend to name his species exactly, but it is certainly winged. That there is genius in these poems is unquestionable; yet it is difficult to assign their author any place in literature, unless, indeed, one may assume the veracity of metempsychosis, and say that here is Hafiz again, only drunk now with Catawba wine instead of the Saoma, and worshipping the Mississippi river instead of the Saravati, which, having dried up in Persia, may be supposed to have also transmigrated westward. Here is the lofty optimism of Hafiz preferring dust-grains to pearls, and his audacity believing that he will gain Paradise only by not shunning hell. And indeed there are some poems of Whitman's in which he seems to yearn towards the East from a westward outlook, as if he were more akin to it than to what America has inherited from Europe. Here is a brief example:—</p><p>'Facing west from California's shores,<br>Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,<br>I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,<br> the land of migrations, look afar,<br>Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;<br>For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of <br>Kashmere,<br>From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,<br>From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,<br>Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,<br>Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,<br>(But where is what I started for so long ago?<br>And why is it yet unfound?)'</p><p>Nevertheless, the Orientalism of the book is manifestly unconscious, it is really meant to be, and is, intensely American. It is but just, however, to say that the America it celebrates is a transcendental one, related to the world and the distant stars, and not 'Uncle Sam's' fenced-in national farm. He sends a health to the world from himself and America—</p><p>'O vapours! I think I have risen with you, and moved <br>away to distant continents, and fallen down there <br>for reasons;<br>I think I have blown with you, O winds;<br>O waters, I have fingered every shore with you.'</p><p>Comparing this volume with the earlier editions of the 'Leaves of Grass' we find that whilst all is retained, including some things that might better have been omitted, there is an entire rearrangement of the pieces, which greatly helps the reader who would find out just what are the central ideas under whose inspiration they have been composed. It is plain that, though the form is often chaotic, the work has a character as a whole. The poems may be classified as celebrations, first, of the individual, and next, of the mass. 'My days I sing, and the land's:' this is the key-note. Himself stands for every individual, and America sums up all lands and ages. That universalism which Mr. Hepworth Dixon found to be the all-pervading element of the Churches and communities of America means much more with Walt Whitman than the future restoration of the wicked, as the following sentences will show:—</p><p>'I believe in the flesh and the appetites;<br>Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me <br>is a miracle.<br>Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am <br>touched from.</p><p>'I dote on myself—there is that lot of me and all so luscious;<br>Each moment, and whatever happens thrills me with joy,<br>O, I am wonderful!<br>I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my <br>faintest wish,<br>Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friend- <br>ship I take again.<br>That I walk up my stoop! I pause to consider if it really be;<br>A morning glory at my window satisfies me more than the <br>metaphysics of books.<br>To behold the day-break!<br>The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows;<br>The air tastes good to my palate.</p><p>'Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,<br>If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.<br>We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun;<br>We found our own, O my soul in the calm and cool of the day-<br> break.'</p><p>'Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so;<br>Only what nobody denies is so.<br>A minute and a drop of me settle my brain;<br>I believe the soggy clods shall become loaves and lamps,<br>And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,<br>And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each <br>other,<br>And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it <br>becomes omnific,<br>And until one and all shall delight us, and we them.'</p><p>'I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the<br> stars. . . . .<br>And I could come every afternoon of my life to look at the farmer's<br> girl boiling her iron tea-kettle and baking short-cake.<br>I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains,<br> esculent roots,<br>And am stuccoed with quadrupeds and birds all over,<br>And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,<br>And call anything close again, when I desire it.'</p><p>When Walt Whitman says en masse, it is always to chant what he claims to be a new theme, only possible to be sung in America, which he calls friendship. He is never weary of celebrating the 'love of comrades,' the 'boys together singing,' the friends' 'hand in hand.' This is the soul of democracy. Here is his 'Song':—</p><p>'Come, I will make the continent indissoluble;<br>I will make the most splendid race the sun ever yet shone upon;<br>I will make divine magnetic lands,<br>With the love of comrades,<br>With the life-long love of comrades.</p><p>I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of<br> America, and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over <br>the prairies;<br>I will make inseparable cities, with their arms about each other's<br> necks;<br>By the love of comrades,<br>By the manly love of comrades.</p><p>For you these, from me, O Democracy, to serve you, ma femme!<br>For you! for you, I am trilling these songs,<br>In the love of comrades,<br>In the high-towering love of comrades.'</p><p>He dreams a dream of 'a city invincible to the attacks of the whole of the rest of the earth,' which is the new City of Friends; and he calls East, West, North, South, to listen to these words:—</p><p>'I believe the main purport of These States is to found a superb <br>friendship, exalté, previously unknown,<br>Because I perceive it waits, and has always been waiting, latent in <br>all men.'</p><p>There is in these poems fullness of expression for clear and vehement convictions; a stateliness of both thought and language; an innocent forgetfulness of all conventionalities; an unconscious nakedness of images; pictorial words without any of the usual poetic conceits and metaphors. There are also swamps and deserts to be passed through, and long stretches of the names of places and occupations which are evidently condensed poems to the author, but which become as hard to get over as Brighton shingles to the ordinary reader. It has, indeed, something of the vastness of the succession of objects in nature, as a forest or savannah, but one does not like to get lost even in forest sublimities. Nevertheless, we have no apprehension that any one with eyes who shall read this volume, will fail to place a very high value upon it. Much has been said of its coarseness. There are, indeed, a few-a very few-portions of it which are coarse, and there are others which, without being coarse, are plain-spoken to a degree not generally permitted to contemporaries, though sometimes praised in ancient books. Whatever may be said of the passages to which we refer, this at least should we say, that they are not written in any defiant or destructive spirit.</p><p>We many notice here that among the young Americans whom this strange poet or prophet has inspired, one, Mr. John Burroughs, has written an interesting account of him, the advance sheets of which a friend has kindly placed in our hands. The following extracts will doubtless interest our readers:—</p><p>'On his father's side his stock is English; on his mother's, Holland-Dutch. From his father he inherits his large frame and muscular build, his antecedents here being a race of farmers and mechanics, silent, good-natured, playing no high part in society, politics, or the Church, and noted chiefly for strength and size. His early life was passed partly in Brooklyn and partly in the country about forty miles east of Brooklyn, where he lived much in presence of the sea. Between the ages of seventeen and twenty he seems to have been mostly engaged in teaching country schools in his native town and vicinity. It was about this time that he began writing for the press. His first productions, mostly sketches, appeared in the Democratic Review, from which they were copied into some of the newspapers. Between the ages of twenty and thirty he was variously occupied as writer and editor on the press of New York and Brooklyn, sometimes going into the country and delivering political addresses. During this period he was on familiar terms of acquaintance with William Cullen Bryant, and the two were in the habit of taking long walks, which, of course, were equivalent to long talks, in and about Brooklyn. In 1850 he went to New Orleans in the capacity of editor, where he remained a year. On his trip to and from that city he made it a point penetrate various parts of the West and South-west, particularly to explore the Mississippi and its tributaries, searching, one might say, for hints and models to be used in the making of his poems.</p><p>'He does not seem to have conceived the idea of writing 'Leaves of Grass' till after his thirtieth year. How he was led to adopt this style of expression, thoroughly versed as he was in the literature of the day, is uncertain. The most probable explanation is that he felt hampered by the old forms and measures, and saw that if America ever came to possess a style of her own, it would be in the direction of more freedom and scope-a feeling in which many of his contemporaries are beginning to share. For three or four years before he began to write in this vein, and while his loaf was leavening, as it were, he was a diligent student of the critical literature of the age, delving into foreign magazines and quarterly reviews, and collecting a vast amount of matter, bearing upon poetry and literature generally, for further use and study. It is quite probable that this course of reading had some influence in determining his own course as a poet, and that he knew well beforehand wherein the head and front of his work would lie. It has not been with his eyes shut that he set himself against the popular tastes and standards, and wrote for an audience of which he did not count upon the present existence of a single member. It cannot be said with the same force of any other writer, living or dead, that he must 'wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of himself.'</p><p>'When 'Leaves of Grass' was written and published, the author was engaged in putting up small frame-houses in the suburbs of Brooklyn, partially with his own hands and partly with hired help. The book was still-born. To a small job printing-office in that city belongs the honour, if such, of bringing it to light. Some threescore copies were deposited in a neighboring book-store, and as many more in another book-store in New York. Weeks elapsed, and not one was sold. Presently there issued reports from both the stores that the thin quarto, for such it was, should be forthwith removed. The copies found refuge in a well-known phrenological publishing house in Broadway, whose proprietors advertised it and sent specimen copies to the journals and to some distinguished persons. The journals remained silent, and several of the volumes sent to the distinguished persons were returned with ironical and insulting notes. The only attention the book received was, for instance, the use of it by the collected attachés of a leading daily paper of New York, when at leisure, as a butt and burlesque-its perusal aloud by one of the party being equivalent to peals of ironical laughter from the rest.</p><p>'A small but important occurrence seems to have turned the tide. This was the appearance of a letter from the most illustrious literary man in America, brief, but containing a magnificent eulogium of the book. A demand arose, and before many months, all the copies of the thin quarto were sold. At the present date, a curious person, pouring over the shelves of second-hand book stalls in side places of the city, may light upon a copy of this quarto, for which the stall-keeper will ask him treble its first price.'</p><p>We feel a certain responsibility in alluding to this strange work; but there is that in it, with all its eccentricity and vagueness, which removes it from the category of common-place books, and places it among those of which a critic is bound to give a fair and impartial account. It is unfortunate that this odd poet should have spoiled so much beautiful work with even one smear of nastiness; but however we may regret his having done so, we cannot afford to lose what he has given us because he has not given it in a purer spirit. He is far more chaste than Mr. Swinburne, whom he resembles in many particulars; he is not more irreverent than Shelley; he is in some points more dramatic than either, and far less hurtful. There is a wild, natural exuberance of animalism displayed by Whitman of a thoroughly original kind, an open-air abandonment, a weird and exalted receptivity embracing the good and the bad, the vice and the virtue of life, with a power and comprehensiveness as striking as it is novel. If he will but learn to tame a little, America will at last have a genuine American poet.</p><p>We are not defending Whitman's audacity, nor maintaining that a poet may run counter to every social and religious belief and law, because he is a poet; but genius is too rare and too precious a gift to the world to be lost and forgotten simply on the score of its raving at times. Besides, Whitman removes grossness out of the reach of passion, renders it completely unsuggestive or alluring by his uncovered and unornamented distinctiveness. We have read leading articles in newspapers far more subversive of nicety in modest thought than the worst of Whitman's erotics, if erotics we can term his rhapsodical worship of form and flesh. At the same time Whitman is not a poet for the family circle, nor is his book one which could be allowed into everybody's hands. Taking 'Leaves of Grass' on the whole, we have no hesitation in pronouncing them to be leaves containing noble and sublime images-leaves in which there is a throbbing and real pulse of that great sympathy which indicates the poet, and for which we are disposed to forgive a taint of earthiness and mould which may in a future edition be removed.</p><p>Walt Whitman.</p><p>BY ROBERT BUCHANAN.</p><p>THE grossest abuse on the part of the majority, and the wildest panegyric on the part of a minority, have for many years been heaped on the shoulders of the man who rests his claim for judgment on the book of miscellanies noted below. Luckily, the man is strong enough, sane enough, to take both abuse and panegyric with calmness. He believes hugely in himself, and in the part he is destined to take in American affairs. He is neither to be put down by prudes, nor tempted aside by the serenade of pipes and timbrels. A large, dispassionate, daring, and splendidly-proportioned animal, he remains unmoved, explanatory up to a certain point, but sphinx-like when he is questioned too closely on morality or religion. Yet when the enthusiastic and credulous, the half-formed, the inquiring, youth of a nation begin to be carried away by a man's teachings, it is time to inquire what these teachings are; for assuredly they are going to exercise extraordinary influence on life and opinion. Now, it is clear, on the best authority, that the writer in question is already exercising on the youth of America an influence similar to that exercised by Socrates over the youth of Greece, or by Raleigh over the young chivalry of England. In a word, he has become a sacer vates—his ministry is admitted by palpable live disciples. What the man is, and what the ministry implies, it will not take long to explain. Let it be admitted at the outset, however, that we are in concert with those who believe his to be a genuine ministry, large in its spiritual manifestations, and abundant in capability for good.</p><p>Sprung from the masses, as he himself tells us, Walt Whitman has for many years lived a vagabond life, labouring, as the humour seized him, and invariably winning his bread by actual and persistent industry. He has been alternately a farmer, a carpenter, a printer. He has been a constant contributor of prose to the Republican journals. He appears, moreover, at intervals, to have wandered over the North American continent, to have worked his way from city to city, and to have consorted liberally with the draff of men on bold and equal conditions. Before the outbreak of the war, he was to be found dwelling in New York, on ‘fish-shape Paumanok,’ basking there in the rays of the almost tropical sun, or sallying forth into the streets to mingle with strange companions—from the lodging-house luminary and the omnibus driver, down to the scowling rowdy of the wharf bars. Having written his first book, ‘Leaves of Grass,’ he set it up with his own hands, in a printing-office in Brooklyn. Some of our readers may dimly remember how the work was briefly noticed by contemporary English reviews, in a way to leave the impression that the writer was a wild maniac, with morbid developments in the region of the os pelvis. On the outbreak of the great rebellion, he followed in the rear of the great armies, distinguishing himself by unremitting attention to the wounded in the Ambulance Department, until, on receiving a clerkship in the Department of the Interior, he removed to Washington. Here, to the great scandal of American virtue, he continued to vagabondize as before, but without neglecting his official duties. At the street corner, at the drinking-bar, in the slums, in the hospital wards, the tall figure of Walt Whitman was encountered daily by the citizens of the capital. He knew everybody, from the President down to the crossing-sweeper.</p><p>‘Well,’ said Abraham Lincoln, watching him as he stalked by, ‘he looks like a man.’</p><p>Latterly, his loafing propensities appear to have grown too strong for American tolerance, and he was ejected from his clerkship, on the pretext that he had written ‘indecent verses,’ and was a ‘free lover.’ His admirers, indignant to a man at this treatment, have accumulated protest upon protest, enumerating numberless instances of his personal goodness and self-denial, and laying powerful emphasis on certain deeds which, if truly chronicled, evince a width of sympathy and a private influence unparalleled, perhaps, in contemporary history. With all this personal business we have no concern. His admirers move for a new trial on the evidence of his written works, and to that evidence we must proceed.</p><p>In about ten thousand lines of unrhymed verse, very Biblical in form, and showing indeed on every page the traces of Biblical influence, Walt Whitman professes to sow the first seeds of an indigenous literature, by putting in music the spiritual and fleshly yearnings of the cosmical man, and, more particularly, indicating the great elements which distinguish American freedom from the fabrics erected by European politicians. Starting from Paumanok, where he was born, he takes mankind in review, and sees everywhere but one wondrous life—the movement of the great masses, seeking incessantly under the sun for guarantees of personal liberty. He respects no particular creed, admits no specific morality prescribed by the civil law, but affirms in round terms the universal equality of men, subject to the action of particular revolutions, and guided en masse by the identity of particular leaders. The whole introduction is a reverie on the destiny of nations, with an undertone of forethought on the American future, which is to contain the surest and final triumph of the democratical man. A new race is to arise, dominating previous ones, and grander far, with new contests, new politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts. But how dominating? By the perfect recognition of individual equality, by the recognition of the personal responsibility and spiritual significance of each being, by the abrogation of distinctions such as set barriers in the way of perfect private action—action responsible only to the being of whom it is a consequence, and inevitably controlled, if diabolic, by the combined action of masses.</p><p>Briefly, Walt Whitman sees in the American future the grandest realization of centuries of idealism—equable distribution of property, luminous enlargement of the spiritual horizon, perfect exercise of all the functions; no apathy, no prudery, no shame, none of that worst absenteeism wherein the soul deserts its proper and ample physical sphere, and sallies out into the regions of the impossible and the unknown. Very finely, indeed, does the writer set forth the divine functions of the body—the dignity and the righteousness of a habitation existing only on the condition of personal exertion; and faintly, but truly, does he suggest how from that personal exertion issues spirituality, fashioning literatures, dreaming religions, and perfecting arts. ‘I will make,’ he exclaims, ‘the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the most spiritual poems; and I will make the poems of my body and of mortality: for I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and of immortality.’</p><p>This, we hear the reader exclaim, is rank Materialism; and, using the word in its big sense, Materialism it doubtless is. We shall observe, further on, in what consists the peculiar value of the present manifestation. In the meantime, we must continue our survey of the work.</p><p>Having broadly premised, describing the great movements of masses, Walt Whitman proceeds, in a separate ‘poem’ or ‘book,’ to select a member of the great democracy, representing typically the privileges, the immunities, the conditions, and the functions of all the rest. He cannot, he believes, choose a better example than himself so he calls this poem ‘Walt Whitman.’ He is for the time being, and for poetical purposes, the cosmical Man, an entity, a representative of the great forces.† He describes the delight of his own physical being, the pleasure of the senses, the countless sensations through which he communicates with the material universe. All, he says, is sweet—smell, taste, thought, the play of his limbs, the fantasies of his mind; every attribute is welcome, and he is ashamed of none. He is not afraid of death; he is content to change, if it be the nature of things that he should change, but it is certain that he cannot perish. He pictures the pageant of life in the country and in cities; all is a fine panorama, wherein mountains and valleys, nations and religions, genre, pictures and gleams of sunlight, babes on the breast and dead men in shrouds, pyramids and brothels, deserts and populated streets, sweep wonderfully by him. To all those things he is bound:—wherever they force him, he is not wholly a free agent; but on one point he is very clear—that, so far as he is concerned, he is the most important thing of all. He has work to do; life is not merely a suck or a sell; nay, the whole business of ages has gone on with one object only—that he, the democrat, Walt Whitman, might have work to do. In these very strange passages, he proclaims the magnitude of the preparations for his private action:—</p><p>‘Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;<br>How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?</p><p>What is a man, anyhow?

But more extraordinary, in their strong sympathy, are the portions describing the occupations of men. In a few vivid touches we have striking pictures; the writer shifts his identity like Proteus, but breathes the same deep undertone in every shape. He can transfer himself into any personality, however base. ‘I am the man—I suffered—I was there.’ He cares for no man's pride. He holds no man unclean.</p><p>And afterwards, in the poem called ‘Children of Adam,’ he proceeds to particularize the privileges of flesh, and to assert that in his own personal living body there is no uncleanness. He sees that the beasts are not ashamed; why, therefore, should he be ashamed? Then comes passage after passage of daring animalism; the functions of the body are unhesitatingly described, and the man asserts that the basest of them is glorious. All the stuff which offended American virtue is to be found here. It is very coarse, but, as we shall see, very important. It is never, however, inhuman; indeed, it is strongly masculine—unsicklied by Lesbian bestialities and Petronian abominations. It simply chronicles acts and functions which, however unfit for art, are natural, sane, and perfectly pure. We shall attempt to show further on that Walt Whitman is not an artist at all, not a poet, properly so called; and that this grossness, offensive in itself, is highly significant—an essential part of very imperfect work. The general question of literary immorality need not be introduced at all. No one is likely to read the book who is not intelligently chaste, or who is not familiar with numberless authors offensive to prudes—Lucretius, Virgil, Dante, Goethe, Byron, among poets; Tacitus, Rabelais, Montaigne, Cervantes, Swedenborg, among prose thinkers.</p><p>The remainder of ‘Leaves of Grass’ is occupied with poems of democracy, and general monotonous prophecies. There is nothing more which it would serve our present purpose to describe in detail, or to interpret. The typical man continues his cry, encouraging all men,—on the open road, in the light of day, in the region of dreams. All is right with the world, he thinks. For religion he advises, ‘Reverence all things’; for morality, ‘Be not ashamed’; for political wisdom among peoples, ‘Resist much—obey little.’ He has no word for art; it is not in her temple that he burns incense. His language, as even a short extract has showed, is strong, vehement, instantaneously chosen; always forcible, and sometimes even rhythmical, like the prose of Plato. Thoughts crowd so thick upon him, that he has no time to seek their artistic equivalent; he utters his thought in any way, and his expressions gain accidental beauty from the glamour of his sympathy. As he speaks, we more than once see a man's face at white heat, and a man's hand beating down emphasis at the end of periods. He is inspired, not angry; yet as even inspiration is not infallible, he sometimes talks rank nonsense.</p><p>The second part of the volume, ‘Drum-Taps,’ is a series of poetic soliloquies on the war. It is more American and somewhat less mystical than the ‘Leaves of Grass’; but we have again the old cry of democracy. Here, in proportion to the absence of self-consciousness, and the presence of vivid emotion, we find absolute music, culminating once or twice in poetry. The monody on the death of Lincoln—’when lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed’—contains the three essentials of poetic art—perfect vision, supreme emotion, and true music. This, however, is unusual in Walt Whitman. Intellectual self-consciousness generally coerces emotion, insincerities and follies ensue, and instead of rising into poetry, the lines wail monotonously, and the sound drops into the circle of crabbed prose.</p><p>For there is this distinction between Walt Whitman and the poet—that Whitman is content to reiterate his truth over and over again in the same tones, with the same result; while the poet, having found a truth to utter, is coerced by his artistic sympathies into seeking fresh literary forms for its expression. ‘Bawling out the rights of man,’ wrote Horne Tooke, ‘is not singing.’ Artistic sympathies Walt Whitman has none; he is that curiously-crying bird—a prophet with no taste. He is careless about beautifying his truth: he is heedless of the new forms—personal, dramatic, lyrical—in which another man would clothe it, and in which his disciples will be certain to clothe it for him. He sees vividly, but he is not always so naturally moved as to sing exquisitely. He has the swagger of the prophet, not the sweetness of the musician. Hence all those crude metaphors and false notes which must shock artists, those needless bestialities which repel prudes, that general want of balance and that mental dizziness which astonish most Europeans.</p><p>But when this has been said, all blame has been said, if, after all, a man is to incur blame for not being quite another sort of being than nature made him. Walt Whitman has arisen on the States to point the way to new literatures. He is the plain pioneer, pickaxe on shoulder, working and ‘roughing.’ The daintier gentlemen will follow, and build where he is delving.</p><p>Whitman himself would be the first to denounce those loose young gentlemen who admire him vaguely because he is loud and massive, gross and colossal, not for the sake of the truth he is teaching, and the grandeur of the result that may ensue. There are some men who can admire nothing unless it is ‘strong’; intellectual dram-drinkers, quite as far from the truth as sentimental tea-drinkers. Let it at once and unhesitatingly be admitted that Whitman's want of art, his grossness, his tall talk, his metaphorical word-piling, are faults—prodigious ones; and then let us turn reverently to contemplate these signs which denote his ministry, his command of rude forces, his nationality, his manly earnestness, and, last and greatest, his wondrous sympathy with men as men. In actual living force, in grip and muscle, he has no equal among contemporaries. He emerges from the mass of unwelded materials—in shape much like the Earth-spirit in Faust. He is loud and coarse, like most prophets, ‘sounding,’ as he himself phrases it, ‘his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.’ He is the voice of which America stood most in need—a voice at which ladies scream and gigmen titter, but which clearly pertains to a man who means to be heard. He is the clear forerunner of the great American poet, long longed for, often prophesied, but not perhaps to be beheld till the vast American democracy has subsided a little from its last and grandest struggle. Honour in his generation is of course his due, but he does not seem to solicit honour. He is too thoroughly alive to care about being tickled into activity, too excited already to be much moved by finding himself that most badgered of functionaries, the recognized Sir Oracle.</p><p>Walt Whitman's ‘Leaves of Grass,’ ‘Drum-Taps,’ etc New York, 1867. </p></p>Let it be understood, here and elsewhere, that we shall attach our own significance to passages in themselves sufficiently mystical. We may misrepresent this writer; but, apart from the present constructions, he is to us unintelligible.</p><p>1. WALT WHITMAN's Drum-Taps New York. 1865. 12mo. pp. 72.</p><p>2. Sequel to Drum-Taps. (Since the preceding came from the Press.) When Lilacs last in the Dooryard bloomed, and Other Pieces</p><p>IT is fortunate that 'Walt Whitman's Drum-Taps,' unlike his 'Leaves of Grass,' is in point of propriety unexceptionable, so that it can be judged on its intrinsic merits.</p><p>The pieces of which 'Drum-Taps' consists are in form, like those in 'Leaves of Grass,' neither blank verse nor rhythmical prose. A poet of genuine artistic power would suffer from the absence of those restraints which are to genius what its banks are to a river,—limitations that aid in the development of beauty and of force; and Mr. Whitman is so far from being an artist, that he boasts of his lack of culture, after the fashion of 'self-made' men. Yet it is precisely this deficiency which disguises his real excellence, and stands between him and the fame he predicts for himself. A writer whose works are to live must have taste to discriminate between what is worth saying in a given poem, and what is not worth saying, and must have courage to excise the latter. The business of cataloguing the works of creation should be left to the auctioneer.</p><p>Poets of vastly more genius and culture than Mr. Whitman possesses have committed the error of thinking all objects and fancies equally worthy of a poem. Wordsworth, for example, patched his shining robes with homespun; but Wordsworth had the manners and speech of a gentleman, while Whitman has the characteristics, good and bad, of a Bowery boy. His love of New York City has more in common with Gavroche's love for Paris than with that of Victor Hugo, and more in common with Tony Weller's love for London than with that of Dr. Johnson, Lamb, or even Dickens. His glorification of America smacks of the 'We can lick all creation' of Tammany Hall. But with the extravagance, coarseness, and general 'loudness' of Bowery boys, Mr. Whitman possesses in an unusual degree their better traits. He is not ashamed of the body he lives in, and he calls all things by plain names. His compositions, without being sentimental or pretty, show genuine sensibility to the beauty of nature and of man. His braggart patriotism evinced its genuineness during the war.</p><p>'Beauty, knowledge, fortune, inure not to me, yet there are two things inure to me.<br>I have nourished the wounded and soothed many a dying soldier;<br>And at intervals I have strung together a few songs,<br>Fit for war and the life of a camp.'</p><p>The fact that the 'songs' in Drum-Taps were written under such circumstances ought to have rebutted in the most fastidious minds whatever presumption may have been raised against the volume by previous publications.</p><p>But the claims of these productions to consideration rest upon a more solid basis than the author's personal services in the hospital. Mr. Whitman not only possesses an almost photographic accuracy of observation, a masculine directness of expression, and real tenderness of feeling, but he sometimes hits upon an original epithet which illuminates a page of prosaic details. He speaks of 'the sturdy artillery…soon, unlimbered to begin the red business'; 'the hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted, robust year' (1861); the 'hinged knees and steady hand' of the dresser of wounds; the 'elderly (sick) man, so gaunt and grim, with well-grayed hair and flesh all sunken about the eyes'; 'million-footed, superb-faced Manhattan'; 'the wind with girlish laughter'; the 'gentle, soft-born, measureless light'; 'the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air'; 'the most excellent sun, so calm and haughty'; 'the huge and thoughtful night.' And in at least three places he shows more sustained, if not higher power. The effect of the news from Sumter upon New York is thus described:—</p><p>'The Lady of this teeming and turbulent city,<br>Sleepless, amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,<br>With her million children around her—suddenly<br>At dead of night, at news from the South,<br>Incensed , struck with clenched hand the pavement.'</p><p>'Old Ireland' is personified as</p><p>'Crouching over a grave, an ancient, sorrowful mother,<br>Once a queen,now lean and tattered, seated on the ground,<br>Her old white hair drooping dishevelled round her shoulders;<br>At her feet fallen an unused royal harp.'<br><p>But Mr. Whitman's faculty is, perhaps, most fully shown in the poem entitled, 'When Lilacs Last in the Door-Yard Bloomed'; in which the contrast of the beauty and life of the opening spring with the scenes presented and the thoughts awakened by the funeral of Abraham Lincoln is drawn with unexpected power. The poem is, as a whole, remarkable, but we must content ourselves with a brief quotation.</p><p>'Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities;<br>Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes—passing the endless grass;<br>Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown <br>fields uprising;<br>Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave<br>Night and day journeys a coffin.<br>. . . . .<br>Through day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land,<br>With the pomp of the inloop’d flags, with the cities draped in black,<br>With the show of the States themselves, as of crape-veil’d women, standing,<br>With processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night,<br>With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,<br>With all the mournful voices of the dirges, poured around the coffin,<br>The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs—Where amid these you journey,<br>With the tolling, tolling bells’ perpetual clang,<br>Here! coffin that slowly passes,<br>I give you my sprig of lilac.</p><p>Walt Whitman.*</p><p>BY ROBERT BUCHANAN.</p><p>THE grossest abuse on the part of the majority, and the wildest panegyric on the part of a minority, have for many years been heaped on the shoulders of the man who rests his claim for judgment on the book of miscellanies noted below. Luckily, the man is strong enough, sane enough, to take both abuse and panegyric with calmness. He believes hugely in himself, and in the part he is destined to take in American affairs. He is neither to be put down by prudes, nor tempted aside by the serenade of pipes and timbrels. A large, dispassionate, daring, and splendidly-proportioned animal, he remains unmoved, explanatory up to a certain point, but sphinx-like when he is questioned too closely on morality or religion. Yet when the enthusiastic and credulous, the half-formed, the inquiring, youth of a nation begin to be carried away by a man's teachings, it is time to inquire what these teachings are; for assuredly they are going to exercise extraordinary influence on life and opinion. Now, it is clear, on the best authority, that the writer in question is already exercising on the youth of America an influence similar to that exercised by Socrates over the youth of Greece, or by Raleigh over the young chivalry of England. In a word, he has become a sacer vates—his ministry is admitted by palpable live disciples. What the man is, and what the ministry implies, it will not take long to explain. Let it be admitted at the outset, however, that we are in concert with those who believe his to be a genuine ministry, large in its spiritual manifestations, and abundant in capability for good.</p><p>Sprung from the masses, as he himself tells us, Walt Whitman has for many years lived a vagabond life, labouring, as the humour seized him, and invariably winning his bread by actual and persistent industry. He has been alternately a farmer, a carpenter, a printer. He has been a constant contributor of prose to the Republican journals. He appears, moreover, at intervals, to have wandered over the North American continent, to have worked his way from city to city, and to have consorted liberally with the draff of men on bold and equal conditions. Before the outbreak of the war, he was to be found dwelling in New York, on 'fish-shape Paumanok,' basking there in the rays of the almost tropical sun, or sallying forth into the streets to mingle with strange companions—from the lodging-house luminary and the omnibus driver, down to the scowling rowdy of the wharf bars. Having written his first book, 'Leaves of Grass,' he set it up with his own hands, in a printing-office in Brooklyn. Some of our readers may dimly remember how the work was briefly noticed by contemporary English reviews, in a way to leave the impression that the writer was a wild maniac, with morbid developments in the region of the os pelvis. On the outbreak of the great rebellion, he followed in the rear of the great armies, distinguishing himself by unremitting attention to the wounded in the Ambulance Department, until, on receiving a clerkship in the Department of the Interior, he removed to Washington. Here, to the great scandal of American virtue, he continued to vagabondize as before, but without neglecting his official duties. At the street corner, at the drinking-bar, in the slums, in the hospital wards, the tall figure of Walt Whitman was encountered daily by the citizens of the capital. He knew everybody, from the President down to the crossing-sweeper.</p> <p>'Well,' said Abraham Lincoln, watching him as he stalked by, 'he looks like a man.'</p><p>Latterly, his loafing propensities appear to have grown too strong for American tolerance, and he was ejected from his clerkship, on the pretext that he had written 'indecent verses,' and was a 'free lover.' His admirers, indignant to a man at this treatment, have accumulated protest upon protest, enumerating numberless instances of his personal goodness and self-denial, and laying powerful emphasis on certain deeds which, if truly chronicled, evince a width of sympathy and a private influence unparalleled, perhaps, in contemporary history. With all this personal business we have no concern. His admirers move for a new trial on the evidence of his written works, and to that evidence we must proceed.</p><p>In about ten thousand lines of unrhymed verse, very Biblical in form, and showing indeed on every page the traces of Biblical influence, Walt Whitman professes to sow the first seeds of an indigenous literature, by putting in music the spiritual and fleshly yearnings of the cosmical man, and, more particularly, indicating the great elements which distinguish American freedom from the fabrics erected by European politicians. Starting from Paumanok, where he was born, he takes mankind in review, and sees everywhere but one wondrous life—the movement of the great masses, seeking incessantly under the sun for guarantees of personal liberty. He respects no particular creed, admits no specific morality prescribed by the civil law, but affirms in round terms the universal equality of men, subject to the action of particular revolutions, and guided en masse by the identity of particular leaders. The whole introduction is a reverie on the destiny of nations, with an undertone of forethought on the American future, which is to contain the surest and final triumph of the democratical man. A new race is to arise, dominating previous ones, and grander far, with new contests, new politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts. But how dominating? By the perfect recognition of individual equality, by the recognition of the personal responsibility and spiritual significance of each being, by the abrogation of distinctions such as set barriers in the way of perfect private action—action responsible only to the being of whom it is a consequence, and inevitably controlled, if diabolic, by the combined action of masses.</p><p>Briefly, Walt Whitman sees in the American future the grandest realization of centuries of idealism—equable distribution of property, luminous enlargement of the spiritual horizon, perfect exercise of all the functions; no apathy, no prudery, no shame, none of that worst absenteeism wherein the soul deserts its proper and ample physical sphere, and sallies out into the regions of the impossible and the unknown. Very finely, indeed, does the writer set forth the divine functions of the body—the dignity and the righteousness of a habitation existing only on the condition of personal exertion; and faintly, but truly, does he suggest how from that personal exertion issues spirituality, fashioning literatures, dreaming religions, and perfecting arts. 'I will make,' he exclaims, 'the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the most spiritual poems; and I will make the poems of my body and of mortality: for I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and of immortality.'</p><p>This, we hear the reader exclaim, is rank Materialism; and, using the word in its big sense, Materialism it doubtless is. We shall observe, further on, in what consists the peculiar value of the present manifestation. In the meantime, we must continue our survey of the work.</p><p>Having broadly premised, describing the great movements of masses, Walt Whitman proceeds, in a separate 'poem' or 'book,' to select a member of the great democracy, representing typically the privileges, the immunities, the conditions, and the functions of all the rest. He cannot, he believes, choose a better example than himself so he calls this poem 'Walt Whitman.' He is for the time being, and for poetical purposes, the cosmical Man, an entity, a representative of the great forces.† He describes the delight of his own physical being, the pleasure of the senses, the countless sensations through which he communicates with the material universe. All, he says, is sweet—smell, taste, thought, the play of his limbs, the fantasies of his mind; every attribute is welcome, and he is ashamed of none. He is not afraid of death; he is content to change, if it be the nature of things that he should change, but it is certain that he cannot perish. He pictures the pageant of life in the country and in cities; all is a fine panorama, wherein mountains and valleys, nations and religions, genre, pictures and gleams of sunlight, babes on the breast and dead men in shrouds, pyramids and brothels, deserts and populated streets, sweep wonderfully by him.

He is inspired, not angry; yet as even inspiration is not infallible, he sometimes talks rank nonsense.</p><p>The second part of the volume, 'Drum-Taps,' is a series of poetic soliloquies on the war. It is more American and somewhat less mystical than the 'Leaves of Grass'; but we have again the old cry of democracy. Here, in proportion to the absence of self-consciousness, and the presence of vivid emotion, we find absolute music, culminating once or twice in poetry. The monody on the death of Lincoln—'when lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed'—contains the three essentials of poetic art—perfect vision, supreme emotion, and true music. This, however, is unusual in Walt Whitman. Intellectual self-consciousness generally coerces emotion, insincerities and follies ensue, and instead of rising into poetry, the lines wail monotonously, and the sound drops into the circle of crabbed prose.</p><p>For there is this distinction between Walt Whitman and the poet—that Whitman is content to reiterate his truth over and over again in the same tones, with the same result; while the poet, having found a truth to utter, is coerced by his artistic sympathies into seeking fresh literary forms for its expression. 'Bawling out the rights of man,' wrote Horne Tooke, 'is not singing.' Artistic sympathies Walt Whitman has none; he is that curiously-crying bird—a prophet with no taste. He is careless about beautifying his truth: he is heedless of the new forms—personal, dramatic, lyrical—in which another man would clothe it, and in which his disciples will be certain to clothe it for him. He sees vividly, but he is not always so naturally moved as to sing exquisitely. He has the swagger of the prophet, not the sweetness of the musician. Hence all those crude metaphors and false notes which must shock artists, those needless bestialities which repel prudes, that general want of balance and that mental dizziness which astonish most Europeans.</p><p>But when this has been said, all blame has been said, if, after all, a man is to incur blame for not being quite another sort of being than nature made him. Walt Whitman has arisen on the States to point the way to new literatures. He is the plain pioneer, pickaxe on shoulder, working and 'roughing.' The daintier gentlemen will follow, and build where he is delving.</p><p>Whitman himself would be the first to denounce those loose young gentlemen who admire him vaguely because he is loud and massive, gross and colossal, not for the sake of the truth he is teaching, and the grandeur of the result that may ensue. There are some men who can admire nothing unless it is 'strong'; intellectual dram-drinkers, quite as far from the truth as sentimental tea-drinkers. Let it at once and unhesitatingly be admitted that Whitman's want of art, his grossness, his tall talk, his metaphorical word-piling, are faults—prodigious ones; and then let us turn reverently to contemplate these signs which denote his ministry, his command of rude forces, his nationality, his manly earnestness, and, last and greatest, his wondrous sympathy with men as men. In actual living force, in grip and muscle, he has no equal among contemporaries. He emerges from the mass of unwelded materials—in shape much like the Earth-spirit in Faust. He is loud and coarse, like most prophets, 'sounding,' as he himself phrases it, 'his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.' He is the voice of which America stood most in need—a voice at which ladies scream and gigmen titter, but which clearly pertains to a man who means to be heard. He is the clear forerunner of the great American poet, long longed for, often prophesied, but not perhaps to be beheld till the vast American democracy has subsided a little from its last and grandest struggle. Honour in his generation is of course his due, but he does not seem to solicit honour. He is too thoroughly alive to care about being tickled into activity, too excited already to be much moved by finding himself that most badgered of functionaries, the recognized Sir Oracle.</p><p>∗ Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass,' 'Drum-Taps,' etc New York, 1867.</p><p>†Let it be understood, here and elsewhere, that we shall attach our own significance to passages in themselves sufficiently mystical.
