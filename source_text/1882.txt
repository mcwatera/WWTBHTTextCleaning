<p>'Leaves of Grass.' </p><p>We believe that literary folk will be glad that Walt Whitman has found his publisher, and that the interests of American literature, which owes a good deal to Walt Whitman, will be regarded by the publication of all of his poems. Not a single one should be omitted, as all are needed to indicate the measure of his genius and to preserve the harmony between his purpose and his accomplishment. We believe that this harmony expresses a deep religious feeling. There is no immorality in Walt Whitman, or in his poetry, to the reader who has poetic instinct and poetic insight with that imagination and studious penetration which the correct reading of true poetry always implies. Poetry does not require metre, rhythm, or any particular form for its expression; poetry has an unlimited range of all subjects, and the right to treat them in its own way; poetry always has an ulterior and worthly purpose, to which its expression is only a mode of approach; poetry demands of its readers understanding, imagination and fancy. This book is an American classic.</p><p>[Leaves of Grass By Walt Whitman. Philadelphia, Rees, Welsh & Co. Price, $2.] </p><p>WALT WHITMAN'S POEMS. </p><p>When James R. Osgood & Co., of Boston, concluded to bring out a revised and enlarged edition of WALT WHITMAN's 'Leaves of Grass,' they did the best thing possible for American literature, and performed an act of justice towards the most thoroughly original of American bards. WALT WHITMAN is in himself—and in his book, which is himself—the soul of the new and generous continent. He has its asserting egotism, its crude force, its prolific and bounteous vitality. He has the abounding hospitality, the inspiriting positivism of a people that have girdled the forests and chained the mountains and linked to the respectable traditions of a dead past the vital energies of the living present, and who see in the future they shall conquer, the fulfillment of their dearest prophecies and their divinest expectations.</p><p>Reading carefully the nearly three hundred pages of 'Leaves of Grass' the student, both of literature and of humanity, can but wonder at the strange power that manifests itself in every paragraph. They may criticise the form of expression, may question the taste of certain passages, but the overlying grace of the poet and the underlying spirit of the philanthropist animate every part. Here is the vigor and splendor that have called forth the admiration of an EMERSON, a LONGFELLOW and a TENNYSON. It is the largeness and vitality of the primal man—the gigantic and multiplied possibilities of a continent of vast lakes and praries, and rivers and mountains and far-reaching, fertile plains. The effeminate and hot-house reader has no need of its pages. As well could he exchange his satin-covered and rose-scented couch for a bed among the pine boughs of the Sierras. Its living imagery and masterly action is to them both coarse and crude. This Elijah in the wilderness, with his coarse vesture and fiery self-assertion, is quite as much an object of scorn to the dainty esthetes as was the old prophet to the college boys who shouted, 'Go up thou bald head!' But the new bard is a prophet too, and as such is willing to wait the slow appreciation that comes to the forerunner in any line. Nearing the conclusion of his volume he says:—</p><p>'When America does what was promised,<br>When through these States walk a hund-<br>red millions of superb persons,<br>When the rest part away for superb per-<br>sons and contribute to them,<br>When breeds of the most perfect mothers <br>denote America,<br>Then to me and mine our due fruition.'</p><p.WALT WHITMAN is the poet of democracy, of strict and absolute equality, who exalts woman alike with man. He is the poet of powerful figures, and there is nothing outside of HOMER and the Bible that equals the splendor of his imagery or the elevation of an occasional passage. The thirty-six pages of military verse under the heading 'Drum Taps' contain matchless descriptions of scenes of camp and battle, unequalled by those of any modern writer. 'Autumn Rivulets' and 'From Noon to Starry Night' are full of indescribable flights. Quoting from the closing poem again, 'So Long,' the poet prophesies of what shall come after him:</p><p>'I announce natural persons to rise,<br>I announce justice triumphant,<br>I announce uncompromising liberty and <br>equality,<br>I announce the justification of candor and <br>the justification of pride.</p><p>I announce a life copious, vehement, <br>spiritual, bold,<br>I announce the end that shall lightly and <br>joyfully meet its translation.'</p><p>After all that has been written it is scarcely necessary for us to add that while there are passages in 'Leaves of Grass' that for the sake of the immature and casual reader we would gladly obliterate, yet as a sign of the time when a distinctively American school of literature shall arise, vigorous, wholesome, pure, breezy as the praries and lofty as the Sierras, we welcome WALT WHITMAN and his book. It is a splendid protest against the fine spun and sickly effeminacy of the AMANDA MATILDA poetry of the American magazine. It is very strong meat but good for vigorous digestion. 'Camerado,' we return your kiss. Though 'disembodied, triumphant, dead,' you will dwell forever in the epic of democracy.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS By Walt Whitman. Boston: James B. Osgood & Co. Detroit: Thorndike Nourse. </p><p>That Walt Whitman is genuine and thoroughly believes in himself is beyond question. It does not therefore follow that he is a poet, though we have noticed that those who insist most strenuously upon his claim to be so considered, base the claim mainly on his genuineness and self-confidence, waiving for the moment all discussion as to the beastliness of certain of his verses—there really is no other word which fitly characterizes them—his poems, so-called, very rarely furnish any excuse for their appearance in the poetic form. There is no rhyme or pretense of any, nor is there any attempt at meter. With one or two exceptions they might just as well be written like other prose.</p><p>Of course this does not settle the question. There is a great deal of poetry in the English language without either rhyme or meter. But it is recognized as such in spite of the prosaic form; while Walt Whitman's ebullitions, if put in that form, would not be. Printed as prose they would strike the reader as grandiloquent, sonorous, rhetorical, sometimes as imaginative, almost always as egotistical, but very rarely as poetical. Take, for example, such a verse as the following, strike out the misplaced capitals and the spaces, in short, print it as prose is printed, and see how much of the 'divine afflatus' can be detected in it:</p><p>Sauntering the pavement or riding the country by <br>road, lo, such faces!<br>Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, <br>ideality,<br>The spiritual prescient face, the always welcome <br>common benevolent face.<br>The face of the singing of music,the grand faces <br>of natural lawyers and judges, broad at the <br>back-top.<br>The faces of hunters and fishers, bulged at the <br>brows, the shaved,blanched faces of ortho-<br>dox citizens.<br>The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning <br>artist's face.<br>The ugly face of some beautiful soul,the hand-<br>some, detested or despised face.</p><p>This now is too lamentable a face for a man.<br>Some abject louse asking leave to be,cringing for <br>it,<br>Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig <br>to its hole.</p><p>As for the beastly portion of the volume,'The Children of Adam,' it is an outrage upon the decencies of literature. It is open, undisguised sensualism of the grossest sort; and its publication is a grave mistake. We have no special fear that it will corrupt the rising generation, for its indecency is so potent that intelligent parents and guardians will look out for it. But when such a work, with the imprint of a highly respected publishing house, has free circulation and transmission through the mails, an argument almost unanswerable is furnished for the professional perverters of youth whose vile trash, heretofore excluded from the mails, is really less indecorous in form—whatever it may be in spirit—than some portions of 'Leaves of Grass.'</p><p>''Walt Whitman's' Leaves of Grass.' </p><p>This is a republication of the original edition, now nearly twenty years old, restoring all the fleshly matter since expurgated, and having the addition of late songs. It is intended to be the author's full expression to date, and we trust that it is. The book has nearly four hundred pages of close print. The conscientious reading of it and every page of it in the hope that the next line might be different, has consumed two rainy days of leisure. For such time and patience Walt Whitman owes to each reader an unpayable debt.</p><p>The subject of the book is the Body, the Soul, the Sexes, Democracy, New York with its Firemen and Ferries, the Civil War, Lincoln and America—all as revolving in their orbits around Walt Whitman, and cheered in their courses by the sound of what he felicitously calls his 'barbaric yawp.' He holds himself out as the exemplar of a fuller outer and inner life, whom and which no one can hope to understand from his book, or in any way except to go off tramping with him through cities and the wild lands. One object of the book is to inspire the reader with a desire to enlist in this limited and peripatetic army of martyrs.</p><p>Now, it is undeniable that a few of our upper poets have recognized this as the true voice of a seer in the wilderness. It is equally undeniable that this outlandish soul has conceived many large imaginings, and has outlined them frequently in fitting words. No one can fail to see that this tramp has all the faculties and powers necessary for honorable travel through any realm of earth and air. His epithets and describing words are often admirable. His poetic vision is sometimes clear enough to bring new stars of thought 'to swim within the ken.' He suggests no living or dead man except Ossian,1 and him he imitates with a loud voice. Some bits of lofty expression seem to be Ossianic echoes, but there the resemblance ends. Ossian never fell into [illegible]. Whitman rolls delightedly in the mud-bath. Ossian was always perceptible through his wildest flying clouds. Whitman delights in a jar of sounds which have no clear articulation, and affects the pose of the unconditioned and unthinkable Me. The few glimpses of good through his work seem to come from accidental chinks.</p><p>Whitman's obscenity has provoked the condemnation which he delights to invite. It is of a singular kind. He has fewer unspeakable words than Rabelais,2 and perhaps fewer gross ideas than the gentle Montaigne,3 but Rabelais and Montaigne never went beyond the customary limit of their times, nor reveled in their dirt, but only seemed to go through it in process of natural travel. But Whitman, in an age which has excluded some things from print, seizes upon them as his best and most loving expression of an ideal that has nothing beneath it. With him, love is not allowed the delicate withdrawal of anything from the public gaze. There is nothing so personal that it may be kept sacred, or, at least, invisible. The worst coarseness of Rosseau's Confessions4 is produced here. The corruption exposed in this book would 'infect to the North Star.' Worst of all, it is his text and glory, which he seeks to expound as the teacher and personal propagator of a coming race of fine bodies and souls. The new evolution will develop man into the goatish Satyr and woman into the leaping, foaming Bacchanal. This may not be insanity, but if not, it is 'devilish depravity.'</p><p>Time and space would fail to quote fair samples, out of what is quotable of the perverse workings of this man's brain, but a few may be given. Here is a specimen of the uncouth greatness of his imagination:</p><p>Hefts of the moving word at <br>Innocent gambols silently <br>Rising, freshly exuding,<br>Scooting obliquely high and low.</p><p>Here he is in a better mood:</p><p>I see, just see skyward, great cloud-masses,<br>Mournfully slowly they roll, silently swelling <br>and mixing,<br>With, at times, a half-dimm'd sadden'd far-off <br>star<br>Appearing and disappearing.</p><p>He explains his inspiration thus:</p><p>Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to <br>measure itself,<br>It provokes me forever, it says, sarcastically,<br><em>Walt, you contain enough, why don't you let it out <br>then? </em></p><p>He describes himself in this person:</p><p>Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the <br>son, . . . . <br>Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and <br>breeding,<br>No sentimentalist, no stander above men and <br>women or apart from them,<br>No more modest than immodest.</p><p>He explains the limit of his happiness:</p><p>I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and <br>am happy,<br>To touch my person to some one else's<em> is about as <br>much as I can stand.</em></p><p>And he tells whom and why he loves:</p><p>I dote on myself, <em>there is that lot of me</em> and all so <br>luscious.</p><p><em>Ohe! jam satis!</em> What shall be thought of the man and teacher, who, whatever else he has said, has said such stuff as this?</p><p>It is quite natural that the voice of the new evangel of Art, which has abjured reason, should also abjure rhyme. The object of the book is to deify impulse and lawlessness. What is first desired must be right: the fetters of law are unnatural and tyrannical. So the poet sings without rhyme or rhythm. Every line has its own length regardless of all others, as if in this alone lay the odic force. There is none of the gentle scan of sea-waves, but only the chopping swells of cross-seas. But it must be poetry, for every line begins with a capital letter, and the poet declares that it is poetry, having the chief virtue that you cannot understand it until you have got further along and taken a tramp with Walt Whitman. In two or three places he has put himself under the bondage of rhythm and rhyme. Whenever he does this he writes lines that will live—notably, his 'O Captain, my Captain,' inspired by the fall of Lincoln. This is more than a fine poem, and lamentably shows what Whitman might have done had he not been Walt Whitman.</p><p>In this stage of social evolution mankind has passed beyond hearing the mental and spiritual tramps. Banish him to his own desert places, to love and live with his ineffable Me, and to exalt his raucous voice to the limitless Saharas.</p><p>Published by James R. Osgood & Co. Sold at the book stores.</p><p>'THE POETRY OF THE FUTURE.' </p><p>Here we have it, the real Simon-pure article, and no doubt about it.∗ At least we are so assured by the author and by his admirers. Let us see wherein the poetry of the future differs from the poetry of the past and the present, and whether it can make good its title to be considered the poetry of the future.</p><p>Walt Whitman is a great poet—in his own estimation, and in that of critics who make up in noise what they lack in numbers. This volume is intended to demonstrate to the world that his claim is well-founded; for, like other great men who have an original message to deliver to the world, he has been misunderstood. He should not complain, however, but remember that obloquy is the ordinary lot of genius. This volume, we repeat, is intended to be his vindication. We have read it carefully and curiously-curiously, because though we had heard much of Whitman before, we confess to dense ignorance of all but a hundred lines or so of his writings—and we do not hesitate to say that it is a volume admirably calculated to convince those who were previously of his opinion. That it will convince others we—but this is to pass judgment before the cause is argued.</p><p><strong>His Moral Tone.</strong></p><p>We should not be true to our own convictions if we neglected to protest, on the very threshold of the subject, against the coarse filthiness of the book. The author is by turns blasphemous and obscene, for the mere sake of showing that he dare do anything and say anything that he chooses. We are not sure that the book is not amenable to the laws against sending obscene literature through the mails; and were the Society for the Suppression of Vice to test the matter, any ordinary jury would give a verdict in its favor. The plea that the book is 'literature' does not excuse such unmitigated and indefensible nastiness as disfigures some of its pages. Byron and Swinburne and Oscar Wilde are as modest as a young maiden by comparison. To write such a book and send it forth to the world with a complacent smirk required great courage—or brazen effrontery—on the part of its author; and it is strange that he should have obtained the imprint for it of so respectable a publishing house. [illegible] </p><p>Walt Whitman's artistic creed is easily understood. He states it on the very first page of this volume:</p><p><em>I too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer <br>and greater one than any, <br>Waged in my book with varying fortune, with <br>flight, advance and retreat, victory deferr'd <br>and wavering, <br>(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the <br>last), the field the world, <br>For life and death, for the Body and for the eter- <br>nal Soul. </em></p><p>That is it, war on the social customs and opinions of the age, on its morals, its religion—on everything. Again he says:</p><p>I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not de-<br>cline to be the poet of wickedness also.</p><p>Decline? He jumps at the chance, and wallows in vice and crime at every opportunity. The poet's friends tell us that his life has been correct, that only in his verse is he a libertine; so much the worse for him, he cannot even plead in extenuation of his offence that he had become so accustomed to evil that it is second nature to him. Deliberate baseness is always worse than the baseness that is the outcome of a depraved and bestial nature.</p><p><strong>Is Walt Whitman a Poet?</strong></p><p>No one will dispute Byron's place in the temple of fame, however severely he may condemn the poet's character and the impress it has left on his work. Walt Whitman may be a poet in spite of his immorality. He asks us to accept him as a poet, as a great poet, with a bold egotism which must be either the height of sublimity or the height of folly. Is he a poet?</p><p>That depends, of course, on what one means by poetry. If by poetry we mean verse composed according to regular rhythmical laws, with or without rhyme, Walt Whitman is not a poet. Regular he never is; rhythmical he is at times, but in a wild and irregular way; and of rhyme he is very sparing, for the most part avoiding it altogether. If there are in this volume six consecutive lines to be found anywhere that will 'scan' perfectly according to any one known metre, it may safely be assumed that they exist wholly by accident, not by the poet's design. He simply happened to express himself in that way. But we do not believe that six such lines are to be found; we have looked diligently, and have not discovered them. To return: if poetry be admitted to be, as to its essence, independent of mere form; if irregular, capricious and rugged rhythmical forms be conceded fittingly to embody poetical thought and constitute a different thing from merely poetical prose; then it will be hard to deny that Walt Whitman is, at infrequent intervals, a true poet. That he is a great poet is a preposterous claim, that is not worth the trouble of serious refutation.</p><p>Let us illustrate. Are the following passages poetry or are they not?</p><p>The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice;<br>Let the multitude of isles be glad.<br>Clouds and darkness are round about him;<br>Righteousness and judgment are the habitation <br>of his throne.<br>A fire goeth before him,<br>And burneth up his enemies round about.<br>His lightnings enlightened the world:<br>The earth saw and trembled;<br>The hills melted like wax at the presence of the <br>Lord,<br>At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.<br>The heavens declare his righteousness,<br>And all the people see his glory.</p><p>Departed then over the wavy sea<br>The floater, foamy-necked, most like to a bird,<br>Till about an hour of the second day<br>The twisted prow had sailed,<br>That the voyagers saw land, ocean shores shine,<br>Mountains steep, spacious sea-nesses.<br>Then was the sea-sailer<br>At the end of its watery way.</p><p>The first passage is from Psalm 97; the second a faithful translation from Beowulf, one of the oldest and most valuable relics of Anglo-Saxon literature. The Psalms are commonly called poetry, yet they have neither rhyme nor regular rhythm; Beowulf is called poetry, yet it has nothing to distinguish it from prose but a sort of alliteration. If it be admitted that the above are poetry—of a genuine, though perhaps not of the most perfect, sort—Walt Whitman's claim to be a poet is, perhaps, borne out, but his claim to be an original poet is made ridiculous. At the best he has done ill what David did well over three thousand years ago. But admitting that the Psalms are poetry, can we deny the same title to these lines?</p><p>Smile O voluptuous cool breath'd earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of the departed sunset—earth of the <br>mountains misty-topt!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon <br>just tinged with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and <br>clearer for my sake!<br>Far-swooping elbow'd earth—rich apple-blos- <br>som'd earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes.</p><p>Whether the thought in the above was really worth the trouble of expressing may be a question, but that it is poetically expressed can there be doubt? And where in all English literature should we look for two more exquisite pictures than these, from a poem on Lincoln's death, 'When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed'?</p><p>In the dooryard fronting an old farmhouse <br>near the white-wash'd palings,<br>Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart- <br>shaped leaves of rich green,<br>With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, <br>with the perfume strong I love,<br>With every leaf a miracle—and from this bush <br>in the dooryard,<br>With delicate-color'd blossoms and heart-shaped <br>leaves of rich green,<br>A sprig with its flower I break.<br>. . . . . . .</p><p>Pictures of growing spring and farms and <br>homes.<br>With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the <br>gray smoke lucid and bright.<br>With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, <br>indolent, sinking sun, burning, expand-<br>ing the air,<br>With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and <br>the pale green leaves of the trees prolific,<br>In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast <br>of the river, with a wind dapple here and there,<br>With ranging hills on the banks, with many a <br>line against the sky, and shadows,<br>And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, <br>and stacks of chimneys,<br>And all the scenes of life and the workshops, <br>and the workmen homeward returning.</p><p>Tennyson never wrote a more dainty love-song than this from 'Sea-drift:'</p><p>Two together!<br>Winds blow south, or winds blow north,<br>Day come white, or white come black,<br>Home, or rivers and mountains from home.<br>Singing all time, minding no time,<br>While we two keep together.</p><p>Occasionally he is capable of setting a sublime truth in words that are as beautifully fitted for the purpose as the jeweller's fine gold is to receive and hold the diamond; as when he says of the grass:</p><p>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord.<br>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly <br>dropt,<br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the cor-<br>ners, that we may see and remark, and <br>say <em>Whose?</em> </p><p>Or where he says in the same poem, 'I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars.'</p><p><strong>The Other Side of the Question.</strong></p><p>On the other hand, while one is wading through the unnumbered lines of dreary trash in this volume, how often is he tempted to declare that Walt Whitman has not the poet's gift in the slightest measure—that he is only an ignorant American youth whose culture has been gained wholly from the street-corner and the daily newspaper, who has been smitten with a desire for notoriety, and has shrewdly determined that to be odd and singular is the shortest cut to that end. In what respect do his writhings and contortions, his twistings and turnings of our good old English tongue, differ from the affected attitudes and 'intense' dialect of the 'consummately utter' æsthete who gives us so much sport today? After all, does the ability to write a few fine lines constitute one a poet? Does one kernel of wheat in a bushel of chaff warrant us in giving the name 'grain' to the whole? Evidently not, but evidently also, the single kernel of wheat is wheat in spite of the vast preponderance of chaff. May the question not be answered somewhat like this: Walt Whitman is a poet, after a fashion, but he has written very little poetry. If he is not of those who 'die with all their music in them,' as Dr. Holmes sings, he yet may have succeeded in uttering but a small part of the music that is in him. For noise, be it remembered, is not music.</p><p>One further characteristic needs to be touched on in forming a complete and final judgment of the value of Whitman's work. He shows an aptness now and then for coining those</p><p>Jewels five-words-long<br>That on the stretched forefinger of all Time<br>Sparkle forever.</p><p>What could be better, for example, than his description of the sound of the carpenter's plane, as it 'whistles its wild ascending lisp'? Anybody who has ever heard the sound will appreciate the striking fitness of the phrase. 'Far-sprinkled systems' is a most happy epithet for the clear sky of a winter's night; and nothing could better picture in words the thronged thoroughfares of New York than this line:</p><p>When million-footed Manhattan unpent de-<br>scends to her pavements.</p><p>What poet has apostrophized Death more happily than this: 'Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet'? And in all the poetry written about the death of President Garfield, has there been a single phrase so peculiarly happy as 'the sobbing of the bells…those heartbeats of a Nation in the night'? But if one shall say of these things, One swallow does not make a summer, nor do a few happy turns of phrase make a poet—for our part we could only assent.</p><p>But, it may be asked, does Walt Whitman never submit to the trammels of poetry, as poetry is ordinarily conceived? Never fully, yet once he comes very near to doing so—in a poem on the death of Lincoln—and this is the result:</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is <br>done,<br>The ship has weather'd every rock, the prize we <br>sought is won,<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people <br>all exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel <br>grim and daring;<br>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>O the bleeding drops of red,<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the <br>bells;<br>Rise up—for you the flag is hung—for you the <br>bugle trills,<br>For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for <br>you the shores a-crowding,<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager <br>faces turning;<br>Here Captain! dear father!<br>This arm beneath your head!<br>It is some dream that on the deck<br>You've fallen cold and dead.</p><p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale <br>and still,<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse <br>nor will,<br>The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage <br>closed and done,<br>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with <br>object won;<br>Exult O shores, and ring O bells!<br>But I with mournful tread,<br>Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>The most prejudiced will not deny that that is poetry, but Walt Whitman is not half so proud of it himself as he is of some of his 'barbaric yawps.' Nevertheless, he will be known fifty years hence—if he is known then at all, which we more than half-doubt—only as the author of 'My Captain,' on the whole, probably, the most stirring lyric that the civil war produced. Contrast with such a poem lines like these:</p><p>Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow <br>flapping, with the myriads of gulls win-<br>tering along the coasts of Florida,<br>[illegible] <br>Otherways, there atwixt the banks of the <br>Arkansaw, the Rio Grande, the Nueces,<br>the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red River, the Saskatchawan or the Osage, I with the spring <br>waters laughing and skipping and running.</p><p>Not every writer can drop so quickly and so naturally as he from the level of pure poetry to what is not even prose, but mere drivel.</p><p><strong>A Final Word or Two.</strong></p><p>Walt Whitman is the peculiar product of a peculiar condition of things. He is the 'Bowery Bhoy' in literature, a rowdy with the cacoethes scribendi (in plain English, the itch for writing). He could not have been bred anywhere but in a certain part of New York city a generation ago—in any other place or at another time he could no more have been developed than Plymouth Rocks can be hatched out of cobble-stones. And American letters were in a peculiar transition state when he made his first appearance in print, which fact alone made his career possible. A few devoted admirers have diligently puffed him, and the more judicious critics have ridiculed him into a sort of fame. It is a common saying among publishers that next to very warm praise of a book downright abuse on the part of the critics will best promote its sale. But a popularity thus created is always short-lived; people buy the book for a few weeks just to see whether the critics have told the truth about it, and finding that they have, toss it aside never to look at it again.</p><p>Walt Whitman has certain artistic virtues, it is true; he can paint a pretty pen-picture of nature as it presents itself to the eye, but he has no word for us of 'the still, sad music of humanity' heard throughout nature. How can he tell us what he has never seen—what he has no eyes to see? He has a certain rough power, an aboriginal gift, so to speak, of poetic language, but he is uncouth and barbaric. He has fire, but it destroys oftener than it warms. Though he affects to be as broad as the universe, he is narrow—he has but one note to his pipe, and that a cracked one. Pathos is an element of his power, but it must be allowed that bathos is much more frequent in his writings. As Landor said of Byron, 'there are things in him as strong as poison and original as sin.' He is, after all, too many-sided to be characterized in a single phrase—many-sided in good qualities as well as in evil: At one time he is a dithyrambic Emerson calmly philosophizing on the spiritual truths of the universe; at another he is a prose Swinburne run mad. He is a wicked Tupper; he is an obscene Ossian; he is a poetical Zola; he is—Walt Whitman.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS By WALT WHITMAN. 12mo. pp. 382 Boston: J.R. Osgood & Co. 1881. $2. </p><p><strong>WHITMAN, POET AND SEER </strong></p><p><strong>———</strong></p><p><strong>A REVIEW OF HIS LITERARY SCHEME, WORK, AND METHOD. </strong></p><p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>No writer has been more persistently condemned, and none more persistently and passionately praised, than Walt Whitman has been. He is, we are constantly told, a great poet and a big wind-bag, a profound seer and a boisterous humbug. He disgusts or inspires, he awakens either disdain or devotion. The fine tone of truth has seldom been touched in his case, by even trustworthy critics—although Mr. Stedman has made a temperate and discriminate review of his work. This poet must be, it is insisted, rejected wholly or accepted, and to those who accept him—especially to the young hearts and minds that look straight and sharply to the future—he is an interesting and suggestive personality. It is certainly true that the large reading public, and above all the masses whom Whitman celebrates and extols, have barely an acquaintance or none at all with his books. They have heard of him by way of much acrimonious controversy, and they have perhaps learned by this time that he counts his supporters among some of the liberal and trained minds of Europe. But his public has been, unfortunately, a narrow circle, and his books have not, therefore, been tested after the usual and trying fashion. A chance is now offered to readers who wish to find out for themselves what sort of a poet Whitman is, for his stray writings, collected in a single and convenient book, have just been published, rearranged and edited by the author. This book is the life work, the first and final word, of Walt Whitman. It presents him—or, as he would probably say, his personality—under all possible lights. It brings together, at last, the fractions and outgrowths of his poetic scheme; and it gains thus a harmony and an intellectual completeness which have been heretofore distinctly wanting. If there is clear purpose, and if there is philosophical conception, in Whitman's poems—'ravings' is the word more often said—they should be apparent now. As to his poetic scheme, aside from quality and method of endeavor, that has a breadth and an originality which criticism cannot lessen if it would. Just what this scheme is may be briefly pointed out. Whitman holds himself to be, in the first place, the representative of new forces in society and in nature. He stands for the American democracy, for the unity and supremacy of the mass, for a nationality which may be regarded as the focus and adjustment of all past nationalities, and for a liberty of body and spirit which no other people save the American people has been finally crowned with. So much for his Americanism, which has an inherent meaning and a power, in spite of all that is said to the contrary. The new forces of nature which Whitman represents in his scheme are scientific forces. As Shelley and Hugo have stood forth and sung for revolutionary progress, he stands forth and sings for scientific progress. Others have pictured the future through clamor and fire of struggle; he pictures it through the spiritual and material evolution of man. It is here that Whitman is most personal and original. He is the first poet who has touched nature through close knowledge; the first poet who has suggested amply(?) the law and the harmony of the universe, the first who has looked upon external life as a cosmos. He—the leader of his line—has attempted to express what Henry Sedgwick called 'cosmic emotion.' He has undertaken to grasp the facts of the world and to make these known as poetic facts; to avoid those new literary idealisms and conventionalisms which, to the naturalist and thoughtful observer, are empty child-talk. Poets have written nobly and feelingly of the force and mystery of nature, but always with the slightest possible bulk of learning. Nature is fittingly, truthfully, and powerfully described in the great books of science, not in the songs of the poets. Whitman must have felt this long ago, and he threw himself into the spirit of his century, a century of broad inquiry, keen analysis, and wonderful synthesis. Many of his poems contain the only glimpses to be found in poetry of the real order and meaning of nature. His poetic scheme, therefore, may be rightfully called original.</p><p>Democracy and cosmos—these, then, are the two starting points in Whitman's ambitious undertaking. His ideas radiate from these points. They lead to his views upon humanity, personality, individual freedom, fraternity, and labor; to his notion of the identity of body and spirit; to his theory of chastity and morality; to his idealization of peoples and trades; to the necessity of egotism and charity; to his conception of progress, and to the essential godhead of man. He seeks, perhaps unconsciously, to stand as an idealist and as a realist, to make democracy and men seem what they are not, and to tell plain facts about them at the same time. Toward nature he is, so far as he goes, a realist; because he is always striving to realize the truth—absolutely the scientific truth—of nature. He is, it is plain, an optimist and an egotist of the most pronounced type; for to be these is to arrive, with him, at natural conclusions. His motive as a poet is essentially a manly and straightforward one, however far and wrong of the mark he may occasionally go; for he preaches purity, courage, virility, liberty, and effort. It is one of his doctrines that there is nothing immoral in fact or in act: there is simply immorality of purpose. He believes that there is forgiveness for all sins, and, perhaps, that Walt Whitman is especially designed to define such forgiveness. He believes in the strength and glory and security of humanity, and, by a clear deduction, in the immensity of self. He incarnates humanity in himself, and his mission, in his own eyes, becomes Christ-like. He disdains, of course, the accepted laws of art. He imagines that he can do without these. He constructs, therefore, a language fitted to himself. He stands—so he seems to think—too high for art. Beauty of form may be left to the polishers and piano players; it is not for the prophets and the Whitmans. On the whole, we have here a poet who has frankly tried less to write a book than to find voice for a man. In one of his first poems he exclaims: 'The modern man I sing.' In one of his last he adds: 'Who touches this touches a man.' His text is—and it is a stalwart text: 'I stand in my place, with my own day, here!'</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>It has been shown what Whitman has striven to be and to do. No one could be more in sympathy with what is real and vital in his scheme than the present writer is. But conception is not execution, and Whitman's plans are infinitely better than his work. One should hardly need to be told, in an epoch so critical and so keenly alive to humor as our own, that mere brag and buncombe and assertion do not pass unchallenged as strength; that noise and strain are not power; that extravagance is not inspiration; that orphic talk is not prophecy. It is right, of course, to credit Whitman with sincerity, with the honesty of his convictions. Many are loth to own this much; though no person, minded to learn and see the truth, can read this poet's work through and fail to feel its occasional fire and stir. Whitman writes, at his best, with deep emotion and conviction. He rises at moments to heights of poetic insight and inspiration. There are a fine lyrical sweep and a genuine epic breadth in a few of his poetic rhapsodies. This would be more clearly felt if his work were not so thickly rutted with that insane kind of nonsense which some devoted worshipers persist in calling great thought and great poetry. Whitman's work is like a rich garden embedded in weed. Flower and weed are here inextricably blended. The brag, and assertion, and wrench of this American seer will never be accepted above their value by those who know that the finest art is a result of the finest sifting of thought, intelligence, emotion, and vigor. Art, in a high sense, is the test of strength, not the sign of weakness. In placing himself above art, in confounding the ability to discriminate and shape with mere technical dexterity, Whitman puts himself on the wrong side of nature. This would not be a matter of much moment, it is true, if his clamorous upholders were not seemingly bent upon elevating his method to a doctrine. The poet who labors with no fetters runs to chaos. Nature is like true art in this; it creates within laws. What is more simple and lovely to the sight than a flower? Yet consider the forces that make the flower, the elements that are parts of it, the intricacy of its mechanism; and compare these with the exquisite grace and appropriateness of its outward form. It is a rule in nature that all chaos shall tend to form and harmony; the universe is, when looked at singly, as simple a thing as the cup of a lily. Whitman and writers with his disposition pretend to be the true sight-seers of nature, while they awkwardly reflect its lawlessness and complexity. The harmony and the simplicity of nature are not shown in Whitman's poems, even when these are most true and suggestive. To teach a doctrine of lawlessness, therefore, is about the least intelligent project that his blind followers have tried to carry out.</p><p>Destructive criticism might be applied to Whitman's little understood and much discussed Americanism. There is certainly a thing which may be called Americanism. This is frequently flashed out in these poems, but it is not lucidly expressed. At times it amounts to palpable rigmarole, which no one but a jaded European nurtured amid the tiresome and mournful strife of the Old World could mistake for the real thing. Our country, it may be explained, represents certain new ideas of nationality and advancement. It represents at the present moment, more strikingly and splendidly than any other land under the sun does, scientific progress as opposed to revolutionary progress. It is a land to which all the currents, and longings, and peoples of history move like rivers converging to one stream and one mouth. It is the mother of individual liberty, freedom of thought, and peaceful labor; a land , therefore, in which the researches of the world are most nobly welcomed, which leads the nations toward a righteous justice, which gives a home to all aliens. What progress may do will awaken here, above all, response and sympathy. Our country illustrates, in brief, the advancing spirit of the nineteenth century. This is certain and clear. On the other hand, we are not a people of the old rugged and uncivilized sort. We are not like those for whom Homer sang, and we stand in no need of a Moses nor of a Mohammed. We are not chiefly—as some of the exuberant persons on the other side of the Atlantic seem to think—hewers of wood and drawers of water. Our lasting honor is—and this is certainly overlooked—that our pioneership is above all intellectual. A ripe and vigorous civilization is at the heart of the land. The rabble and the unthinking mob do not represent our real vitality and progress. It should be plain, then, that our country has a peculiar individuality and a decisive mission. It is a strange union of past, present, and future. A poet like Whitman—who rhapsodies more often than he thinks and sings—is sure to suggest something of our individuality and he has, without doubt, gone further than other poets. But his conception of our land and people is full of inexactitude, full of false idealism, and loaded with extravagance. There is too much of the red-shirted Hoosier about it. It comes close at times to the spread-eagleism of our astonishing orators, and to the fraternity of the bar-room. Its permanent merit is that it reflects, after all, something of the free and creative sprit which is the spring-source of our life. It tells us of our liberty—a small matter which our ancestors strove mournfully through hundreds of years to win, and which, now that we have got it, we are apt to prize rather loosely and humorously.</p><p>All that has been written above might be illustrated by columns of extracts from 'Leaves of Grass.' But others may pick these out for themselves. I have simply sought to show broadly that there are radical sins and false premises at the very basis of these poems. Whitman's theory of life and humanity, and his absolute lack of sound artistic instinct and taste, lead him into extravagances which have as much relation to strong and true song as a fishmonger's bawl has to the melody of birds, or to the musical roll of water upon a stretch of shore. They lead him, also, into some monstrous excesses, and the poems comprised in 'Children of Adam' are naked exhibitions of these. The poems in question have been struck by many lances, denounced by many mouths. Good ink has been wasted upon them. They are over-Whitmanish and not beautiful. In these fleshly diatribes the poet sets out to 'make illustrious' that which is not commonly discussed in sensible and good company. He throws off his shirt, so to speak, and cries lustily. 'Behold, I am Walt Whitman, I am moral.' Poets have sung with more or less sense of creation—Whitman goes down to the actual facts. This may be moral. It is intended as an illustration of the highest morality. But it is—unless the world has gone wrong since the beginning of time—indecent and vulgar, not one degree above the loose talk which is, unfortunately, common enough in low places and high. As to its pretentious morality, that does not deceive, and it is solely justified in the poet's inner consciousness. The things here uttered by Whitman may be, unquestionably, thought of chastely, but they cannot be written down and seem either pure or modest. At best, they are coarse commonplace, imposed upon the reader with prophetic earnestness. At worst, they are unlawful exposures of the person.</p><p>It is a relief to turn from this fustian to the 'Song of Myself,' which is a healthy expression of vigorous humanity and imaginative egotism—a poem in which the relation of a man to his fellow-creatures, and to his world, and to the universe, is set forth at moments with real power of manner, breadth of sympathy, and original feeling. The contradictions in this poem are clearly the result of forethought and design, for it is the good and bad in a man, according to Whitman, that awake the unchecked energy of his nature. 'I resist anything better than my own diversity,' he says. And he adds, with rare courage: 'I accept Reality and dare not question it.' There is the right sort of materialism in the following chant:</p><p>'Smile, O voluptuous cool-breath'd earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountain's <br>misty topt:<br>Earth of the vitreous form of the fall moon just <br>tinged with blue:<br>Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the <br>river:<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and <br>clearer for my sake.<br>Far-swooping elbow'd earth—rich apple-blossom'd <br>earth.<br>Smile, for you lover comes.</p><p>'Prodigal, you have given me love—therefore I <br>to you give love.<br>Oh, unspeakable, passionate love!'</p><p>Here is another passage from the same poem, and in the poet's less rhapsodic manner:</p><p>'I think I could turn and live with animals, they <br>are so placid and self-contained.<br>I stand and look at them long and long.</p><p>'They do not sweat and whine about their condi-<br>tion,<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for <br>their sins.<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty <br>to God.<br>Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with <br>the mania of owning things,<br>Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that <br>lived thousands of years ago.<br>Not one is respectable and unhappy over the <br>whole earth.'</p><p>There is, of course, the usual bulk of orphic and oracular utterance in the 'Song of Myself,' and much of this is solemn commonplace merged into a species of transcendentalism. Its meaning is not always clear. But, on the other hand, the poetry in this song has strength and reach. The following verses were admiringly quoted by Prof. Clifford in his essay on 'Cosmic Emotion:'</p><p>'I open my scuttle at night and see the far- <br>sprinkled systems,<br>And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher, <br>edge but the rim of the farthest systems.</p><p>'Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always <br>expanding.<br>Outward and outward and forever outward.</p><p>'My sun has his sun, and round him obediently <br>wheels,<br>He joins with his partners a group of superior <br>circuit,<br>And greater sets follow, making specks of the <br>greatest inside them.</p><p>'There is no stoppage, and never can be stoppage,<br>If I, you, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, <br>were this moment reduced back to a pallid <br>float, it would not avail in the long run,<br>We should surely bring up again where we now <br>stand,<br>Ana surely go as much farther, and then farther, <br>and farther.</p><p>'A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of <br>cubic leagues, do not hazard the span, or <br>make it impatient,<br>They are but parts, anything is but a part.</p><p>'See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of <br>that.'</p><p>In the 'Song of the Open Road,' 'Song of the Answerer,' 'Song of Joys,' 'Song of the Exposition,' 'Song for Occupations,' and in other poems more or less identical in spirit with these, there is expressed with undoubted sincerity and vigor, entire sympathy with the moods of nature, with the longings and work of mankind, and with the various sides of life. They are singular combinations of triviality, prosiness, poetic feeling, and arrogant personality. They lack, above all, the fine simplicity and clear brevity of songs meant for the popular ear and heart. Yet they have an intensely modern and popular spirit:</p><p>'Away with themes of war! away with war <br>itself!<br>Hence from my shuddering sight to never more <br>return that<br>Show of blacken'd mutilated corpses!<br>That hell unspent and void of blood, fit for wild <br>tigers or for lop-tongued wolves, not reason-<br>ing men,<br>And in its stead speed industry's campaigns,<br>With thy undaunted armies engineering,<br>Thy pennants labor, loosen'd to the breeze,<br>Thy bugles sounding loud and clear.'</p><p>That is Whitman at his best, free of verbiage and pretension, and with something to say worth saying, with honest emotion and good sense. The same lyrical sincerity is felt in the invocation to America, ('Song of the Exposition,') when he speaks of 'the common indivisible destiny for all.' The 'Song of the Redwood Tree' is throughout a fine poem, full of brain and freedom, and the real hope and faith of our time are simply expressed in the 'Song for Occupations:'</p><p>'The sun and stars that float in the open air,<br>The apple-shaped earth and we upon it, surely the <br>drift of them is something grand,<br>I do not know what it is except that it is grand <br>and that it is happiness.'</p><p>There are truth, ardor, and inspiration in some of the songs included in 'Bird of Passage,' the best of these being 'Pioneers, Oh Pioneers,' which has a rugged rhythmic movement uncommon in Whitman's writings, although the opening to the 'Music of the Storm' is equally fine, while some few other passages which have an exceptional quality of sound and rhythm are quickly remarked. The tenderness, pathos, and manhood in the series of poems called 'Drum-taps' are, perhaps, the most natural and sympathetic touches in Whitman's copious and curious work, and it may be said of this work, finally, that Whitman himself marks their surest claim to attention in some of his closing verses:</p><p>'Comrades, this is no book,<br>Who touches this touches a man,<br>(Is it night? are we here together alone?)<br>It is I you hold, and who hold you,<br>I spring from the pages into your arms.'</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>The permanent value of these poems, in fact, is to be sought in their two clear merits: in their modernness, breadth, and originality of purpose, and in their presentiment of a strong and fresh individuality. The aim of these poems, and the man behind them, are more distinctive than the poems themselves. 'Who touches this touches a man' is an assertion which is felt to be perfectly just. The book—judged by the standard of all great books—falls far below greatness. There is no single poem in it which could be safely compared with any single great poem in our language. Whitman's work is fine in flashes, in strong passages, or in sudden descriptions. It is weighed down, on the other hand, with extravagances and excesses like those already spoken of, with a mass of ill-digested learning, with long stretches of windy prose, with violent and insecure handling of deep themes, with all kinds of crudity and with a manner which is seldom effective and impressive. This manner has been considerably praised by some for its originality and free musical movement, and it has been called by others a formless manner. But it is surely not formless, since it has a perfectly definite form, deliberately chosen and full of artifice. Its rhythm, however—when it has a rhythm—is perfectly commonplace. The prose of Fénélon and Carlyle and the verse of the Bible have incomparably more poetic color, strength of language, melody and harmony of sound, than Whitman's verse at its best. The laws of natural verse are here ignored, and the result is, of course, unnatural. Compare this verse with the unrhymed movement of Shakespeare and Shelley, with that of Wordsworth's sonnets and Keats's odes, and with the rhythmic freedom of Swinburne's 'Song Before Sunrise;' or compare it with the Biblical verse in the Song of Solomon. As to its utility as a medium for the transparent expression of high thought, compare the most intellectual of Whitman's poems with Tennyson's 'In Memoriam.' These comparisons will serve better than criticism—to persons at least who have ears open to musical sound and minds open to conviction. Language is to the poet what color is to the painter, and great and genuine thoughts should have great and genuine expression. To master language, to garment genius fittingly—this is the art of the poet, and this is the art which Whitman and some others appear to despise. It is art that divides truth and passion from commonplace and rant, that draws a sharp line between sustained strength and hyperbolic bluster. Whitman, however, deserves our deepest gratitude for the stand he has taken, in face of this present age, in the fore of its creative work of reconstruction, in front of its iconoclasm and science. Most of the poets—especially the American poet—are probably against him, but the spirit of our time is not to be quenched by literary conventions, and the strong minds of our time are with him. His courageous appeal for more knowledge and still more might be fitly contrasted with the sentimental snivel of those timid creatures who weep at the passing of the good old days. These sad persons are typified by the æsthetic Mr. Wilde:</p><p>'All romance has flown<br>And men can prophesy about the sun.<br>And lecture on his arrows—how, alone<br>Though a waste void the soulless atoms run,<br>How from each tree its weeping nymph has fled,<br>And that no more, 'mid English reeds a Naiad shows <br>her head.</p><p>'Methinks these new Actæons boast too soon<br>That they have spied on beauty: what if we<br>Have analyzed the rainbow, robbed the moon<br>Of her most ancient, chastest mystery,<br>Shall I, the last Endymion, lose all hope<br>Because rude eyes peer at my mistress through a <br>telescope?'</p><p>Those two last lines are worthy of Bunthorne; but they show about as much unconscious humor as most of Bunthorne's contemporaries exhibit when they begin to vent their feelings about romance and science. Weigh such words in the balance with the wise words of Prof. Clifford: 'To some minds there is hope and renewing of youth in the sense that the last word is not yet spoken, that greater mysteries yet lie behind the veil. The prophet himself may say with gladness, 'He that cometh after me shall yet be preferred before me.' But others see in the clearer vision that approaches them the end of all beauty and joy in the earth; because their old feelings are not suited to the new learning they think that learning can stir no feelings at all.' In his article upon 'The Poetry of the Future' (published some months ago in the North American Review,) Whitman wrote these words, which are, I believe, good prophecy: 'Science, having extirpated the old stock fables and superstitions, is clearing a field for verse, for all the arts, and even for romance, a hundred-fold ampler and more wonderful, with the new principles behind. Republicanism advances over the whole world. Liberty, with Law by her side, will one day be paramount—will, at any rate, be the central idea. Then only—for all the splendor and beauty of what has been, or the polish of what is—then only will the true poets appear, and the true poems. Not the satin and patchouly of to-day, not the glorification of the butcheries and words of the past, nor any fight between Deity on one side and somebody else on the other—not Milton, not even Shakespeare's plays, grand as they are.'</p><p>G. E. M.</p><p>———</p><p>Leaves of Grass Boston: JAMES R. OSGOOD & Co. </p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS. </p><p>The animus underlying the songs of Walt Whitman entitled Enfans d'Adam is characteristic of nearly all he has written, and if these had been given their true heading they would have been entitled Enfans de la Bête. Why not? The animal in Walt was free from all conscious restraint, young and lusty, and why should he not sing of its liberties and joys, such as they are? Had not his master proclaimed the precept, 'Act out thyself'? and, having the courage of his convictions, with youthful vigor on his side, the disciple was resolved, in spite of obtrusive advice, to act out fearlessly, at least as far as language and type serve, what was in him.</p><p>Walt Whitman is a more recent and more genuine outcome of transcendentalism. Less tutored, and for that reason—education being what it is—less perverted, he is more a creature of his instincts, and, as it happens, not of the higher sort; and taking his stand on these, he utters himself in accents which at times make the more cultivated transcendentalists hold their breath. Walt is the 'enfant terrible' of transcendentalism. His birth was hailed by the corypheus of this sect with a burst of parental joy; subsequently, on close inspection, he appeared to entertain suspicions of his legitimacy, but now, with maturer examination, his doubts have vanished and he recognizes his lineage.</p><p>The difference between the master and the disciple is this: Mr. Emerson revolted against the false restraints of Calvinism, and, in the righteous indignation of his repressed nature, expressed himself passionately and not seldom unguardedly; while Walt Whitman, unconscious of the impious and paralyzing repression of Puritanism, not having the inherited restraints of seven or eight Puritan ministers wrapt in his skin, takes his master's utterances to the letter and acts them out with all the force of the characteristics of his personality, and in great glee 'sounds his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.'</p><p>Is it a matter for congratulation that the sage of Concord, so-called by his disciples, has not sufficiently recovered from the early strain which was put upon him, seriously to listen in his advanced age to wise misgivings and lawfully-begotten fears?</p><p>But man is a rational animal, and not like the beasts, which have no sense; and all effort on his part to play the irrational beast would be ridiculous, were it not a degradation exacting so great a depravation of his nature. But this attempt is never made with impunity, for man's rational nature sooner or later will surely take revenge on him who makes, whether maliciously or otherwise, the experiment. No, it is not a thing for laughter, but a serious matter, when a man is led to believe that he can with impunity violate any one essential law of his rational being. It is a more serious matter when the leaders of public opinion encourage in a community a belief of this kind, or aid in the spreading of literature infected with such opinions. It is a most serious matter, considering their effect on the coming generation; for the harvest of the poisonous seeds sown in the tender minds of this, will be reaped in the next. And until men gather grapes from thorns and figs from thistles every intelligent, every religious, every moral man, every sincere lover of his race, will set his face fixedly against the teachers and upholders of opinions so degrading to man and so pernicious in their tendency.</p><p>Let us have songs of the 'Enfans d'Adam'—not of the old Adam, but the new! Let us have songs of that blissful communion which existed between God and man in the Garden of Eden—communion lost, alas! by the first Adam, but graciously restored by the second Adam. Songs that spring from this source rise upward and imparadise men's hearts! These are the songs men's souls crave, the age hopes for and is ready to receive.</p><p>SOME RECENT POETRY </p><p>[ . . .] 'Strange,' said Mr. Emerson, when he was asked his opinion of 'Leaves of Grass,' 'strange, that a man with the brain of a god should have a snout like a hog.' And the story ran that Mr. Wendell Phillips, turning the pages of the book, remarked, 'Here seem to be all sorts of leaves except fig leaves.' This was in 1855, and as the original edition lies before us to-day we recall vividly the sensation that was made by its appearance. In the first place, it was an original-looking volume, a homespun affair, a thin quarto of ninety-five pages, printed in large type, and bearing on its title-page no name of any publisher, but only the words 'Leaves of Grass. Brooklyn, New York, 1855.' On the reverse the reader was informed that the book had been duly 'Entered according to act of Congress in the year 1855, by Walter Whitman,' etc., etc., and this was the only clew the public had to the name of the author. Not that the public greatly cared to know. The book was not 'published' in the official sense. It was said that the writer of it was a printer by trade, and that he had set up the type and done all the presswork with his own hands. Perhaps he did the binding as well, for that was as primitive as the rest. Yet, though crude looking to the dapper eyes of the trade, there was a rudimentary good taste in the get-up. The title-page would have pleased Guttenberg or Faust, nor would Aldus himself have despised its large and manly aspect. It is parodied in the new issue, but had Walter Whitman had the ordering of this edition he never would have permitted Mr. Osgood to belittle the title-page with his very uncomfortable trade-monogram, which always makes us think of a trichina, though we have no precise notion of how a trichina looks. We may add that the original edition of 'Leaves of Grass' was embellished with the same portrait of the author that adorns the new Boston edition. The prose preface, however, of ten pages, double columns, is omitted, which is a pity, for it is very characteristic of the author, and shows more clearly than the book itself where the author came from intellectually. Mr. Emerson said once of certain philosophers that they had all been milking the same cow—Swedenborg; and Mr. Whitman, as no one who reads his prose preface can doubt, had been for a long time milking the New England transcendentalists. The preface reads like a selection of papers from the Dial. Parts of it remind one of the 'Manuscript Symphony of Dolon,' but the most of it is an echo of Emerson himself, minus his music and his wit.</p><p>The book, however, was misunderstood, as was to have been expected. Mr. Emerson, who had the penetration to see what was fine and original in it, was as wrong in his judgment of one element in it as was Wordsworth in his judgment of 'Wilhelm Meister.' As Mr. Emerson himself reports: 'He proceeded to abuse Goethe's 'Wilhelm Meister' heartily. It was full of all manner of fornication. It was like the crossing of flies in the air. He had never gone farther than the first part; so digusted was he that he threw the book across the room.' In the marble purity of his mind Mr. Emerson was more shocked than he need have been by Mr. Whitman's plain speaking, for that, after all, is all that his much-berated coarseness amounts to. At first he could not see the wood-god for his phallus. Later, he wrote a letter to Whitman, in which he said, 'I greet you at the beginning of a great career.' Whitman showed that he was not quite a god, for he was so tickled with the compliment that he straightway printed it in letters of gold on the back of a new edition of his book. This was a breach of confidence, as Mr. Emerson thought, and he expressed his private indignation at the liberty taken. But what else did he expect? Had he never read Esop?</p><p>Still, whatever may be Mr. Whitman's personal drawbacks, and no writer ever more freely invited the public to an inspection gratis of all his foibles, the fact remains that Mr. Emerson was right in greeting him as he did. If Whitman really does nothing more than enlarge and exaggerate the 'Nature' and the first yolume of 'Essays' of his master, he does it in a way to entitle himself to the award of originality as much as that master is entitled to it. The doctrines of individualism, of personal independence, of the unity of all souls, of the oneness of man with the universe, of the equal birth of good and evil, these are all here as we had heard them sweetly sung or said by the Orphic seer himself, only they were here jumbled, confused, with endless repetition, without art, without taste, without sense of proportion, and absolutely without humor. Here were scorn of the conventions of society by one who never knew them, and who was as ignorant of society as a Digger Indian; the sincerity of cows and dogs and horses, to whom Adam and his wife and the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day were all as one; a primal nakedness of which the author made a great show of not being ashamed, knowing well enough that the logic of his position made shame unreasonable. And all this, with much more, was put forth in good masculine English with farmer-like shrewdness, without mincing of words or phrases; we heard the plain talk of farm-hands and mechanics, of sailors and soldiers, without the fear of women or of dandies before their eyes.</p><p>The new edition of 'Leaves of Grass' has neither the unity nor the expression of the original book. It is not essentially altered in the main part, nor is what coarseness was once there in the least softened or expunged, but it has been gone over too much with the file, rough as it is still left; and all that Whitman has written since the first book appeared is crowded here pell-mell, without order or sequence. It would be a thousand pities were the author judged by the few passages, perhaps not two pages in all, where his frankness pushes him to say things that are really only coarse because they are said. Of indecency, of essential grossness, there is in the book really nothing. It is easy to believe the author as pure-minded, as Incapable of doing or thinking evil, as any best man among us who would blush to be seen in his shirt-sleeves by a woman. All we charge Whitman with on this score is a want of the sense of beauty and proportion, a want of taste, in short, and worst fault of all, an absolute want of humor. He is neither a true American nor a Greek. Were he the former, he would have a sense of humor; were he the latter, he would have a sense of art. But we owe him a just debt for being what he is, and for the much that he has written it would not be easy to repay him with grateful words. He and Emerson are the only poets we have thus far produced; all the rest are imitators, or make-believes, or players upon jewsharps. But Emerson sits far above Whitman by virtue of his noble art, and, little as he has produced, cannot be brought into comparison with his more prolific disciple. The original 'Leaves of Grass' will remain a real contribution to the thought of America, and some of the additional pieces, 'My Captain, O My Captain,' 'Song of the Banner at Daybreak,' 'Out of the Cradle, Endlessly Rocking,' once read can never be forgotten.</p><p>CLARENCE COOK.</p><p>The Modern Poet has been found at last. We waited long for him but now he is in the midst of us.</p><p>Sweet smelling of pine leaves and grasses, <br>And blown as a tree through and through<br>By winds of the keen mountain-passes,<br>And tender as sun-smitten dew</p><p>his words have come to us across the Atlantic, and in them the first authentic message from the New World to the Old. Need it be said that we speak of Walt Whitman? We are far from slighting the claims of Emerson, Hawthorne, Poe, Longfellow, Bryant, Lowell, and a host of others, but it must be admitted that little or nothing distinctively American has sprung from the best of them. Let us for a moment look at America. The great Western Continent is like a Medea’s cauldron into which along, with the best blood of Europe, Asia and Africa, contributed by annual streams of hundreds of thousands of immigrants, are shredded all the creeds, philosophies, customs and opinions on the face of the earth, Which will find the late of Jason’s uncle, and which of his father, which will be rejuvenated and which will perish out of these mingled traditions French, German, English, Norwegian, Russian, Chinese, in short, of every nation, this is the great problem to be solved, this is the theme which in its entirety no philosopher but Herbert Spencer, no poet but Walt Whitman has ever grappled with. The destinies of our own and of every other country bid fair to be decided in the ultimate outcome of the cauldron, whatever it may be. Is it to be wondered at then that we welcome eagerly the only two men who have seriously set themselves to the task of foreseeing that and telling us frankly as much as they have got foresight of? We now concern ourselves only with the poet, however. His life is as strange as his poetry. At present he is a man of about fifty years of age, still strong and stalwart in spite of a severe stroke of paralysis which prostrated him a year or two ago. He earns his living by the sale of his works, being his own publisher and printer. His leisure is spent in loafing about in a Guernsey shirt and Panama hat among the artizans of Brooklyn and Paumanok and New York, whose society he prefers to any other, but he is accessible to all who want to see him from the highest to the lowest. He seems to have taken up and laid down again a hundred different occupations, having been among other things a pioneer in the backwoods, a tramway conductor in New York, a soldier in the great civil war, a hospital nurse, a newspaper correspondent, and a bookseller. He is said to have written several tales and verses which fell dead from the press before he betook himself to the composition of his great work, his only book indeed, 'Leaves of Grass.' This has employed his whole energy during the last fifteen years. The plan of it enables him to alter and add to it from time to time at his pleasure. The title should speak for itself, yet it may be as well to explain it. Whitman, claiming only to be the poet of common experiences, typifies them naturally under the commonest of common things-grass. Each though is, as it were, a leaf or blade therof which he offers to the reader. But cannot the reader find such thoughts for himself? That is the very conclusion to which the poet would lead him. What then, to enter into particulars, is our author’s subject-matter? The question should rather be, What is not? He sings of all things with the enthusiasm and yet impartiality of nature herself. He is at once the most egotistic and most universal of bards. He invariably speaks in the first person singular but never of the first person singular. It is of you and me and every one, good, bad, and indifferent he talks. He tells us that he loves us and proves it by narrating as parts of his own being our inmost thoughts and feelings, joys and sorrows. Our very crimes he does not shrink from. Sins that we would hide from sun and moon he brings into the glaring light of noonday, but not to condemn—far from it—to shield us, rather, from the world’s scorn by showing them to be natural, and as belonging to himself as much as to anybody. If his book had had a motto it should have been, 'Nihil humani a me alienum puto.' Let it not be supposed that Walt Whitman makes nothing of vice and misery. No one suffers from the sense of them more than he does. But his horror and hatred of sin are always associated with pity and love for the sinner. He regards wickedness—as it should be regarded everywhere—as disease, and nothing more. Had it been so treated for the last thousand years it might have been eradicated from the earth by this time. Whitman celebrates the body equally with the soul (in fact he observes no absolute distinction between the two), and woman equally with man. He carries the doctrine of liberty, equality and fraternity to hitherto undreamed-of issues. He believes in harmonies where theologians catch nothing but discords. Far from looking upon this immeasurable universe as the stakes, as it were, of an eternal game of Whist, in which God and the Soul are partners against the Flesh and the Devil, he takes it to be a field in which all forces on the one side and on the other, contend together in friendly rivalry. He represents Satan as one of the persons of the Godhead. He chants of the Holy Spirit as</p><p>Including all life on earth, touching, including God, including Saviour and Satans,<br>Essence of forms, life of the real identities, permanent, positive,<br>Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man—the general Soul.</p><p>In the deepest sense of the expression , a sense in which Pope, its originator, would never have dared to use it, he believes that 'whatever is, is right,' knowing that in order to [have] one thing being otherwise all the past must have been different throughout infinity and eternity. He accepts and simultaneously rejects every form of religion and philosophy; accepts it as a sufficient embodiment of thought for the times which developed it, but rejects it as inadequate for any other time. He gives us song after song of love and friendship such as have never been sung by mortal man before. He does what no other poet could do—he makes you feel as if, in spite of his never having met you, he were your bosom friend, such as one has dreamt of in school-days, and his words then become sacred to you as a private letter. When we add that our poet tackles astronomy, geology, physiology, chemistry, and in short all the sciences with the same ardour, and that yet he disdains not to sing of the butcher, the baker, and candlestick-maker, the sailor and soldier, and every other individual high or low, beast, man, insect, flower, or stone, we are scarcely sure that we have given even a shadow of an idea of the versatility of genius, and the boundless sympathies and intentions of the man. We recommend our readers to discover as soon as possible how incomplete and inaccurate this notice is by reading Walt Whitman’s volume for themselves. We would as soon attempt to write the topography of the globe as to give a minute description of 'Leaves of Grass.' We have kept to the last a statement, all-important in the case of a Tennyson or a Virgil, but hardly worth mentioning in that of a Walt Whitman, namely, that our author writes in a style neither prose nor verse, the pauses, periods, and rhythms, of which are peculiarly his own. We finish with a quotation.</p><p><em>I DREAMED IN A DREAM</em><br>I dreamed in a dream I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the whole of the rest of the earth,<br>I dreamed that was the new city of Friends,<br>Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love, it led the rest.<br>It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city<br>And in all their looks and words.</p><p>Leaves of Grass.</p><p>Further publication of Walt Whitman's collected poems having been interdicted in Boston, the plates were transferred to Messrs. Rees Welsh & Co., of Philadelphia, whose advance orders exceeded their first edition, a copy of which is before us. This volume was prepared by J. R. Osgood & Co., with the personal supervision of the 'good, gray poet,' and is the only complete and satisfactory edition of his verse. The question of Whitman's place in literature is too involved and difficult for discussion here; it has been argued by able writers in prominent journals, but with no great decisiveness, and it may be doubted whether critics and critical readers will ever be less at variance in their estimates than now. Whitman has passages and stray poems of such obvious strength and beauty as to compel admiration, but their amount is small compared with the mass of matter written in barbaric scorn of all accepted forms, conventionalities, and proprieties. It is difficult to defend many things in Leaves of Grass, even on the author's ground of their necessity to the completion of his 'artistic purpose,' because to the average mind they are purposeless and brutal.</p><p>The portrait given in this volume is not very satisfactory, though doubtless a good copy of the Walt Whitman of years ago. It should at least have been accompanied by one of the present date, like that which appeared last year in Scribner's Monthly, for instance—a head of venerable dignity, in striking contrast to the longshoreman-like figure presented here.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S COMPLETE VOLUME.</strong></p><p>[The publication of Walt Whitman's complete and unexpurgated volume, relinquished by his Boston publishers on account of the objections of the Attorney-General of Massachusetts to certain of its contents, has been undertaken by a Philadelphia publisher. We present, in this connection, some views concerning Whitman's poetry generally, and add some further remarks concerning the propriety of issuing the volume in its present shape.—ED. THE AMERICAN.]</p><p>———</p><p><strong>THE REALISM OF WALT WHITMAN.</strong> </p><p>'IF we look at the matter widely, there is really no such thing as good or bad subjects in poetry, but good or bad poets. Anything, everything, is a fit subject. Art has no business with leading-strings or handcuffs or gags. It says to you, 'Go;' and turns you loose into the great garden of poetry where there is no forbidden fruit.'</p><p>This is Victor Hugo's protest against the disapprobation of those French critics whose conventional imaginations were very much disturbed by the astonishing leaps through time and space that were made by this untrammelled and disorderly genius. It is this same 'quidquid agunt homines,' unrestrained freedom of choice, that Walt Whitman has so urgently insisted upon, when the well-regulated public has remonstrated at what he calls liberty, and society license. If we 'look at the matter widely,' as Hugo recommends, we shall be inclined to agree with the French poet that art should not be handcuffed, and admit as the final test only that the result shall be good poetry; but then this final test must be firmly insisted upon. If a poet has produced really fine poetry, no matter what his material may have been, he has justified himself, at least from the standpoint of his art. But in order to apply this test substantially, we must consider what really good art is; and we find it to be the noble expression of noble ideas; and if it fail in either of these directions it ceases to be the best art. If the ideas are no longer worthy, while the form remains perfect, we have an art that rapidly deteriorates and becomes trivial, and bears within it the germ of decay. If, on the other hand, the ideas are noble and the form indifferent, we have an imperfect, incomplete art, that if it be in a healthy state must soon develop into fuller and finer expression. There is, therefore, not the danger that those concerned with the merely moral side of the question might suppose, in setting art free and cutting her leading strings, as long as the real function of art is recognized. There are plenty of restrictions left, in the severe restraint on hand and eye and speech that true art imposes on her honest servants. What matters it how poor, how mean, how simple the material, if the touch of the artist can turn it to gold, if the imagination can glorify it? There is a certain superb license that brings its own apology with it, when a man of genius is carried over the bounds of convention by the rush of passion, or the glory of beauty, or the heat of a fervid imagination, and is grand at the same time that he is gross, as Shakespeare was sometimes, or Rubens. But if he is only gross without being grand, then there is no quarter for him anywhere, and he is rejected both by morals and art. Realism, for its own sake, has no place in art, least of all in poetry; for poetry, by its very form, separates itself from prose as an imaginative manner of expressing the ideal side of nature and of man's emotions, passions and actions. In prose even brutal realism sometimes justifies itself, when there is need to make reality seem as terribly real as possible and to present facts impressively; but we see to what degradation poetry can be reduced by conscientiously applied realism, even in the hands of a poet of imagination and the most refined sensibilities, a poet who had produced the finest imaginative poetry, in Wordsworth's 'Simon Lee.' And we see to what infinitely lower degradation realism can bring a man without refined sensibilities and a cultivated imagination in Whitman's 'Children of Adam.'</p><p>It is only another proof of the enormous egotism of the man, that he should claim to have made a new departure in insisting on the physical basis of passion, as there is scarcely a poet from Anacreon to Swinburne who has failed to do it ample justice. All that he has done is to tear off, with a rude hand, the thin veil of ideality that 'shadowed its form though not concealed,' and drag it bare before the public, shorn of the finer, higher, purer emotions that sentiment has so intimately associated with it, and stripped of all imaginative charm. This he assuredly has done. It is true that Whitman is a son of the people, and has naturally missed the refining influences of early associations; but then one is forced to remember another son of the people, Robert Burns, and one involuntarily thinks of his</p><p>'O, my Love's like a red, red rose, <br>That's newly sprung in June:<br>O my Love's like a melodie<br>That's sweetly played in tune,'</p><p>when one comes to lines like these,—verses they can scarcely be called:</p><p>'Sometimes with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse unreturned love.<br>But now I think there is no such thing as unreturned love; the pay is certain <br>one way or another.<br>(I loved a certain person ardently and my love was unreturned,<br>Yet out of my love have I written these songs.)'</p><p>Or put this beside it, so full of spontaneousness and the emotion of the hour.</p><p>'O, wha can prudence think upon,<br>And sic a lassie by him?<br>O, wha can prudence think upon,<br>And sae in love as I am?'</p><p>But it is not only to noble or graceful ideas, but to worthy expression of them as well, that poetry owes its power and charm; and it is in this sense of form that Walt Whitman is so essentially lacking. A poet must be an artist, as well as a man of imagination, and however much of an outlaw or rebel he may be in spirit, must submit himself to the laws of his art. Methods he must have though they be of his own choosing, and the man of genius always recognizes the necessity of such restraints. A poet who absolutely ignores the charm of verse, has missed the secret of his art. An English poet who neglects the language of poetry, which is something set apart from the common terms of daily speech, and by preference employs the most hackneyed, prosaic literal expressions of everyday life, has no sense of the sacredness of poetry. When one thinks of what real poetry is, one has hardly patience with a man who could offer the public lines like these, and call them poetry:</p><p>'I tucked my trowser-ends into my boots, and went and had a good time.'</p><p>'Do I contradict myself?<br>Very well then I contradict myself.<br>(I am large, I contain multitudes.)'</p><p>'I reckon I am their boss, and they make me a pet besides.'</p><p>'I assert that all fast days were what they must have been,<br>And that they could no-how have been better than what they were,<br>And that to-day is what it must be, and that America is,<br>And that to-day and America could no-how be better than what they are.'</p><p>Could indifference of ideas and contempt of form be carried further than this?</p><p>In Whitman's case, it is especially unfortunate that he should have failed to conceive of poetry as an art, for every now and then one comes across a burst of something that might have been poetry, and fine poetry too, if it had been shaped by an artist. There is this from the 'Song of Myself':</p><p>'I am he that walks with the tender and growing night.<br>I call to the earth and the sea half held by the night,<br>Press close, bare-bosomed night—press close, magnetic, nourishing night!<br>Night of the south-winds—night of the large few stars!<br>Still, nodding night—mad, naked summer night.'</p><p>There are passages of this quality scattered through the volume in 'Drum Taps,' 'Sea Drift,' 'From Noon to Starry Night,' but they shine like oases among weary pages that are an inextricable tangle of incoherent emotions, epithets, invectives, detached thoughts, inconsequent reflections, un-analyzable, divigations, that spread in straggling unmetrical lines. The author of Leaves of Grass entirely lacks, or has never cultivated any sustained power of construction, and the fact that he has been taken so seriously in Europe is partly due to his astonishing egotism, his defiant tone and fierce assertion of his own individuality, and partly to the undiscriminating manner that prevails in certain English literary circles to find something that shall be unmistakably typical of the new civilization of the crude Western world, something that might pass for the poetry of the self-made man.</p><p>It is not from an ethical standpoint, not from narrow, conservative prejudice, that Walt Whitman's insistent realism is inevitably condemned, but from the vital principles of his art, which it offends beyond reconciliation. He is judged by a canon that he himself would hardly refuse to accept: 'In poetry, there is no such thing as good or bad subjects, but good or bad poets.' T. FRANCIS GORDON.</p><p>'Leaves of Grass.' [By Walt Whitman.] Pp. 382. Rees Welsh & Co., Philadelphia. </p><p>The new edition of Leaves of Grass, by Walt Whitman, is a compact volume of four hundred pages, handsomely printed, and with all of the author's permanent verse included. There ever will be a divided opinion, probably, as to Whitman's claim to rank as a poet. Certain is it that he discards all the canonical rules pertaining to composition, and gives just the expression, regardless of 'feet,' that answers his thought's need. Much of his work, therefore, seems but the record of ideas in the baldest of prose. Here and there is a sentiment embodied which touches the highest poetic afflatus. Yet with a feeling throughout that conventional 'poetry' has all been derided, we find many passages that bear reading again and again, and their strength grows upon one as familiarity is achieved. The author seems to us to be laboring with great thoughts, which he must indite at once to rescue from oblivion, with purpose later to set their excellence in flowing rhyme. They are rough diamonds of poetic thought awaiting the inspired lapidary's skill. The 'fleshly' pieces, of which so much has been said, and which endangered the circulation of the book hereabouts, are to our mind but beatific adorations of the great gift of maternity, and to the purist can be as welcome as the nude statue. With the limitations of our civilization, however, there are but few purists, and the intent of the author can easily be misunderstood by very excellent people, and wholly perverted by the depraved. They are not necessary to any representation of the force or originality of the writer, and as they offend large sections of the community, and furnish prurient curiosity with food for lascivious thought, they had better, as Mr. Emerson originally suggested, be curtailed, if not wholly omitted. It is absurd, however, to rank the work as an obscene or reprehensible one in the broad and literal sense.— Philadelphia, Rees Welsh & Co.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS By WALT WHITMAN. One volume. 12mo. (7 5/8 x 5 3/8 in.), 382 pp., cloth; price, $2. Philadelphia: Rees Welsh & Co. </p><p>'The good gray poet,' stands by his colors and indicates his principles. Having been driven from the modern Athens he now appears undimmed and, it is to be hoped, victorious in the neighbor city of his home. The controversy about the morality of his poems need not here be continued. It is a question to which the old motto of the Garter can be well applied—Honi soit qui mal y pense.1 The lewd imagination which would gloat over Whitman's virile lines would find rot to feed on in the best of books. Here, let it be said, however, that Leaves of Grass, as it stands, is not a book for girls or children. It pictures freely or frankly, with-out winking at, the evils in the world—the evils which every man and woman knows exist, and has to face every day. A great part of Whitman's poems is perfectly sound and safe reading for even the tenderest of girlhood. It seems as if it would be worth while to publish for a more indiscriminate public an edition of Leaves of Grass with the sixty or hundred dubious lines omitted. It might injure the perspective of the work from an ideal point of view, but the gain to the young to be able to read the best of Whitman would certainly amply pay for the sacrifice. The Philadelphia issue of Leaves of Grass is identical in make-up to the Osgood edition.</p><p>Walt Whitman's new publishers, Rees, Welsh & Co of Philadelphia, are evidently cheap sensationalists, quite unfit to issue a great work like 'Leaves of Grass.' It's to be regretted that Whitman had not the patience to wait for some firm of consequence to take up the task Osgood feebly laid down. The Philadelphia firm advertise in this fashion in the Philadelphia Press:—</p><p>''Leaves of Grass,' by Walt Whitman, is not an agricultural book in the hay-makers' parlance; but it's a daisy, and don't you forget it.'</p><p>The Critic justly says that 'this is a worse blow than that dealt by the Massachusetts Dogberry.' These fellows are apparently gamins out of their place. Nothing could be more vulgar than their adoption of 'nigger minstrel' slang for so noble a work, and it can only be explained by supposing that they take Anthony Comstock's ignorant estimate of the 'Leaves of Grass' for gospel, and count on the patronage of the obscene. This seems a great pity, but perhaps it is not so, for it may falsely attract to Whitman through their meaner appetites a class of readers who need to learn his great lessons. Suppose that any one with brain enough reads this great passage,—remembering that Whitman, in his first person, represents the essential man:—</p><p>It is time to explain myself—let us stand up.</p><p>What is Known I strip away—<br>I launch all men and women forward with me into the <br>Unknown.</p><p>The clock indicates the moment—but what does <br>eternity indicate?</p><p>I am an acme of things accomplished, and I an encloser of things <br>to be.</p><p>My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,<br>On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the <br>steps,<br>All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.</p><p>Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,<br>Afar down I see the huge first Nothing—I know I was <br>even there,<br>I waited unseen and always, and slept through the <br>lethargic mist,<br>And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid <br>carbon.</p><p>Long I was hugg'd close—long and long.</p><p>Immense have been the preparations for me,<br>Faithful and friendly the arms that have helped me.</p><p>Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like <br>cheerful boatmen,<br>For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,<br>They sent influences to look after what was to hold <br>me.</p><p>For it the nebula cohered to an orb.<br>The long slow strata piled to rest it on;<br>Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,<br>Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited <br>it with care.<br>. . . . . . .<br>I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled <br>systems,<br>And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge <br>but the rim of the farther systems.<br>Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always <br>expanding,<br>Outward and outward and forever outward.</p><p>There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,<br>If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon <br>their surfaces,<br>Were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would <br>not avail in the long run;<br>We should surely bring up again where we now <br>stand,<br>And surely go as much farther, and then farther and <br>farther.</p><p>A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic <br>leagues, do not hazard the span or make it im-<br>patient;<br>They are but parts, any thing is but a part.</p><p>I know I have the best of time and space, and was <br>never measured and never will be measured.</p><p>I tramp a perpetual journey;<br>My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff <br>cut from the woods;<br>No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair;—<br>I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,<br>I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange;<br>But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a <br>knoll,<br>My left hand hooking you round the waist,<br>My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents <br>and the public road.</p><p>Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,<br>You must travel it for yourself.</p><p>This must be read, as it is written, in the grand manner, and the reader who does not realize that his guide casts behind him the centuries and exhorts him to a new lookout into eternity had better read no more. There has been no more magnificent attitude of command taken than Whitman takes in these utterances, and sustains in almost all that he has written. The trivial person has nothing whatever to do with Whitman.</p><p>ELMINA.</p><p>———</p><p><strong>Suggestions and Advice to Mothers.</strong></p><p>———</p><p><strong>NO.

For years and years has this love and worship of the body been growing and developing in the foremost minds of the race. To-day America's new Poet is singing strong, sweet, heart-invigorating songs to his brothers and his sisters. To-day ears are opening, one by one, to these tuneful melodies, and hearts are thrilling in throbbing responses to the echoes of truths so sweet, so simple, and so harmonious, that the wonder is how for all the years past we have let them be sung in vain and unheeded.</p><p>Many are the books I have read and recommended to the world of seekers for knowledge, truth and wisdom; but now I come with one that has but a doubtful fame as the world goes, but one whose words thrill, enthuse, and stir with a responsive echo such as few poets have been enabled to arouse by their works. This wonderful book is 'Leaves of Grass!'</p><p>Be not startled that I—Elmina, the Quaker Infidel—ask you to take into your homes a volume that has been tabooed, ridiculed and condemned by so many. I do it with a full knowledge of its innate worth and purity. Alone here in the early mornings have I sat conning its entrancing pages—rising refreshed and invigorated as from a draught of freshest water from some wild mountain torrent, a new life in every limb, and a new spirit in every thought. Take, O mothers, a page of Walt Whitman for your morning prayer, and you will begin the day with strong, pure aspirations, and a heart attuned to all that is good, true and beautiful—all that is vigorous, natural and elevating.</p><p>'Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and <br>sweet is all that is not my soul.<br>∗∗∗∗∗<br>While they discuss, I am silent and go and <br>bathe and admire myself.<br>Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, <br>and of any man hearty and clean.<br>Not an inch, or a particle of an inch is vile, <br>and none shall be less familiar than the <br>rest.'</p><p>I feel that I can not do better justice to the book than to give an extract from a lecture on it delivered by one who has himself the soul of a poet, and the heart of a man who loves his race—George Chainey, the lecturer of Paine Hall.  This one on 'Leaves of Grass' I heard him give myself, while I was in Boston, and it determined me to buy the book; and now I feel that I want every mother in the land to own the volume and love it. To own it and read it will be to love it. I wish I had room to quote all of Chainey's lecture, but a part must suffice.</P><p>'Whitman found that he had to chant the glory of the body as well as that of the soul. To him the two are identical.</p><p>'Behold, the body includes and is the mean-<br>ing, the main concern, and includes and <br>is the soul.<br>Whoever you are, how superb and how divine <br>is your body or any part of it!<br>I believe in the flesh and the appetites.<br>Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each <br>part and tag of me is a miracle.<br>Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy <br>whatever I touch or am touched from.<br>The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than <br>prayer.<br>This head more than churches, bibles, and all <br>the creeds,<br>If I worship any particular thing, it shall be <br>some of the spread of my own body.'</p><p>'In his sight, no part or passion of the body is to be slighted or regarded as vulgar. In doing this, he finds it impossible to leave out of his poems the element of sex. I know of nothing that we need to pay such heed to as to what he has to say on this subject. Never will the world be saved from its sickness, pain, and despair, until we take up this element of human life, and treat it as frankly, purely, and reverently as he has. As he says:</p><p>'Sex contains all.<br>Bodies, souls, meanings, proofs, purities, deli-<br>cacies, results, promulgations.<br>Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal <br>mystery, the seminal milk.<br>All hopes, benefactions, bestowals.<br>All the passions, loves, beauties, delights of <br>the earth,—<br>These are contained in sex as parts of itself, <br>and justifications of itself.'</p><p>'Of course, in the treatment of such a subject there must be expressions used that impure minds will prostitute to impure purposes. The fairest, purest, and most beautiful things on this earth are so violated. As Hamlet said to Ophelia, 'Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.' We all know that depraved passions sometimes break down all the barriers of virtue, and do violence to the most maidenly chastity. It is the same low order of morals that thus seeks to drag into the mire the noblest thought and purest purpose of the best benefactors of humanity. The spirit and purpose of Whitman are clearly revealed in the only reply he has yet made to his maligners and persecutors. He tells us that this subject of sex has hitherto been treated of only in two ways. The first, the conventional one of total repression and silence of good folks, creating the feeling that what can not be spoken of must be vile, and so, by covering over disease and depletion, increasing the world's woe. The second is the coarse, vulgar way of speaking of these things that obtains current in many masculine circles, wherein men lose their respect for women, and hold in low esteem their own manhood through learning to take delight in vulgar stories.</p><p>'Alas! we all know that this is true. Thus, the parlor and the barroom have formed a partnership for the propagation of vice. The first doubt lodged in my mind against the claims of the Christian Church and ministry was the first time I spent an evening in the company of three ministers. I expected innocently that the conversation would be on the subject of religion and touching the advancement of the Church. To my surprise and horror, they spent the whole time in regaling one another with smutty yarns. I never was made to blush so much for the company I found myself in before or since. I soon found, however, that this was quite a common practice in the ministerial profession. At camp-meetings, while one or two of their number are thundering at better men and women than themselves to repent or go to hell, the rest are secluded in their private tent, regaling one another in this fashion.</p><p>'Thinking what he might do to reform these perverted tendencies, Whitman concluded that the time had come for a full and frank statement, in loftiest and most earnest manner, of the relation of sex to the health, sanity, and purity of the human race. He desired to connect it with the highest ethical expression of nature and humanity. How nobly and grandly he has done this, none but those who read and love his poems can feel.'</p><p>I could give you a long array of worthy names indorsing and eulogizing this beautiful work, but instead of the names I give you from the book itself.</p><p>'A child said, What is the grass? fetching it, <br>to me with full hands;<br>How could I answer the child?

Grander and purer than all Bibles—a book that shall make lovely women and stalwart men, and sweet, happy, healthful babes.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN.</p><p>In publishing, some fifteen years ago, a volume of selections from the works of Whitman, Mr. Rossetti considered that he was preparing the ground for the ultimate publication in England of a complete edition of the poems of that remarkable, if rather eccentric, writer. That event has now at length taken place (though not, it seems, without unforeseen difficulty of some kind, marked by a long interval between the advertisement and the appearance of the volume, and by a change of publishers apparently at the last moment), and London can at length supply us from its own resources with copies of Leaves of Grass, under which title the author apparently now wishes to include all his poetical works up to the present time.* We are presented at the same time with another work of the same author, the preface to the first edition of Leaves of Grass (published 1855 in a thin quarto, type set up by the author himself), which is now not easily to be met with. This preface was not reprinted in subsequent editions, but was prefixed with some omissions by Mr. Rossetti to his volume of selections. For what has been given us we must be thankful, though we may mildly complain that Whitman's other prose works, consisting of two books—one a magnificent political prophecy, and the other a personal narrative of deep interest—are apparently to be withheld from the English reader, though long ago advertised as published or to be published in company with the preface afore-mentioned. Even in America, says a personal friend of the author, these books can hardly be said to have been published, though readers occasionally find them out, and certainly in England they are little enough known. The reader at the British Museum may find there a copy of Democratic Vistas, but he will search in vain for Memoranda during the War.</p><p>Meanwhile, however, a real service has been rendered to us by the publication in London of Leaves of Grass, and against the printing of the volume there is nothing to be said; it is, in fact, a fine specimen of typography, with few apparent misprints, excellencies which no doubt are fully appreciated by the author, who knows practically what printing is. For those who are acquainted with previous editions of the poems this publication has an interest of its own quite apart from the fact that it is the first complete English edition. There are poems contained in it which have either never appeared before, or only in a separate form not readily to be obtained in this country, as, for instance, the 'Song of the Exposition,' 'After all not to create only,' with its funeral chant for feudalism, which has passed now to its charnel vault—</p><p>Coffin'd with crown and armour on,<br>Blasoned with Shakespere's purple page<br>And dirged by Tennyson's sweet sad rhyme.</p><p>There are also throughout the poems changes of title, omissions, and corrections, such as the author continually makes in his works, for, rough as they seem and often are, the roughness is not caused by want of revision; and, finally, the poems are rearranged, sometimes under new heads altogether, such as 'Autumn Rivulets,' while 'Passage to India' remains only as the title of a single poem, which in 1872 gave its name to a whole volume. But to mention these in detail, and to estimate the effect of them taken together, would be impossible without assuming in the reader a previous knowledge which in most cases he would not possess. We must confine ourselves at present to more general considerations.</p><p>Whitman has been the object of a good deal of enthusiastic and rather undiscriminating admiration, and also of a certain amount of furious and equally undiscriminating abuse. Neither is deserved, but he lays himself open, it must be said, almost equally to both. It is time, however, that an attempt were made to arrive at a sober estimate of his real value; and to the formation of such an estimate those should contribute who, having carefully considered the writings of the man, feel his influence strongly indeed, as all such will, but are not overpowered by it, and see his great merits plainly without being thereby prevented from seeing plainly also his great excesses and defects. A few of such critics have already essayed the task, but it will hardly be said that there is no room for more.</p><p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>It is said, and, so far as I know, said truly, that this prophet is not honoured in his own country. This does not mean that his books have not been bought and read: indeed, the number of copies sold of the first editions of Leaves of Grass is to me rather a subject of surprise. Astonishment at the audacity of the venture must have had some share in raising the public interest, for the book unquestionably sold well. Nor does it mean that the merit of the author was quite unrecognized: on the contrary, by some who were most competent to judge, he was estimated at a very high value. 'The most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed' was Emerson's verdict on the book, and Thoreau thought he saw something almost more than human in the personality of the man. But the mass of his countrymen were not and are not strong enough to accept him; they have perhaps too little confidence in their own literary originality to appreciate duly one from among themselves who breaks through all the conventional usages of literature; they have too much squeamish delicacy to admit to their society one who is so brutally outspoken and unrefined. It is necessary perhaps that this writer, for we need not be zealous to claim for him the title of poet, should be first accepted in the Old World before he can be recognised by the New, which at present can see nothing in literature but by reflected light. Strange irony of fate, if such should be the destiny of one who cast off the conventional forms in order to free himself and his country from Old World influences! 'The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd till his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it.' This he has said and still believes, waiting in confidence for that proof of his title to be forthcoming. But there are many reasons why he should be slowly if at all admitted to his rights, whether in Old World or in New, and to glance at some of these reasons before we proceed further will not be amiss.</p><p>He is perhaps of all writers the most repellent to the reader who glances at him superficially. In the first place he is indecent, and that too not accidentally but on principle. Whatever may be thought of his morality, and that I hold to be essentially sound and healthy, it cannot be denied that in one section of his work, and occasionally throughout the poems and prose, he outrages every ordinary rule of decency. There is nothing impure in this kind of exposure; it has indeed the direct antithesis to prurient suggestion, and the intention of it is unquestionably honest, but from an artistic point of view it is the gravest of faults, it is essentially and irredeemably ugly and repulsive. We are most of us agreed that there is and ought to be a region of reticence, and in to this region the writer had rushed himself and drags us unwillingly after him. He stands convicted of ̓πειροκαλία, if of nothing worse. Akin to this first instance of defect in artistic perception is a second—his use, namely, of words which are either not English or essentially vulgar; and to this must be added a not unfrequent neglect of syntax, which, together with looseness in the application of some words, makes him at times vague or unintelligible. Occasionally there occur words or expressions which, though not ordinarily found in literature, have a native force which justifies them; but generally it is the case that for the French word or for the vulgarism savouring either of the gutter on the one hand or of the Yankee penny-a-liner on the other might be substituted a good English word equally expressive. But here also we too probably have before us a fault of willfulness, for we know that he will not allow the language of English literature to be large enough for the poets of America, but expects accessions to it from Tennessee and California. If, however, he has in his choice of words sought that simplicity which (to quote his own words) is 'the art of art, the glory of expression, and the sunshine of the light of letters,' he has certainly not seldom failed to attain it, and it was hardly to be attained by pouring out indiscriminately into his pages the words which ran naturally off his pen. The 'art of sinking' is illustrated in his juxtaposition of the most incongruous things, and this especially in his well-known catalogues, which, though sometimes picturesque and interesting, are generally only absurd and dull. The fact that they are introduced on principle is not to be admitted as an excuse for the inartistic and formless character, any more than a similar excuse is to be allowed for offences against decency. From many of these faults a sense of humour would have protected him; and this also might have preserved him from some of that violently feeble exaggeration with which he speaks especially of his own countrymen and their institutions, and from the parade with which he sometimes announces truisms, as if they had been just now for the first time discovered by himself. His defence on the general charge is finely given in a poem now published for the first time, written in Platte Cañon, Colorado.</p><p>Spirit that formed this scene,<br>These tumbled rock-piles grim and red,<br>These reckless heaven-ambitious peaks,<br>These gorges, turbulent-clear streams, this naked freshness,<br>These formless wild arrays . . .<br>Was't charged against my chants they had forgotten art? . . .<br>But thou that revelest here, spirit that formed this scene,<br>They have remembered thee.</p><p>But the grandeur of nature is not always to be attained by heaping together uncouth masses. We complain not so much that the work lacks polish, as that the writer has not been preserved by his own native genius from ugly excrescences.</p><p>These artistic defects and his general disregard of form make many of his works repulsive, and do not allow us to accept any one as faultless. But they are mostly such as expurgation could remove, and therefore are not vital. The characteristic which cannot be got rid of, and yet repels, is his intense egotism and self-assertion. His longest, and in some respects most important, work—a poem of twelve or fourteen hundred lines, with which the original Leaves of Grass opened—has or had his own name as the title† and his own personality as the subject; and this self-assertion of the individual is perhaps the prevailing characteristic of Whitman's work, that which makes it in fact representative in some degree of the spirit of the age; and the egotism, after all, is not so much personal as typical. The poet is a Kosmos, and contains within himself all unity and all diversity. What he claims for himself he thereby claims for others on the same terms. 'Underneath all, to me is myself, to you yourself.' We feel when the poet proclaims himself 'an acme of things accomplished,' for whose birth all the forces of the universe have been a preparation, he is speaking less for himself individually than for humanity, the humanity of his own day and of future days. The egotism becomes more offensive when it is obviously personal and indicates himself as the Michael Angelo of literature; and that, it must be admitted, is not unseldom, though here too he claims to be speaking less for himself than for the future of democratic poets. To these charges it may be added that, notwithstanding his boasted freedom from the trammels of conventionality, he is in his more ordinary work a mannerist of the most vulgar kind. 'Oh! to realise space!' 'Have you reckoned a thousand acres much?' 'Has any one supposed it lucky to be born? I hasten to inform him or her that it is just as lucky to die.' 'I have said that the soul is not more than the body, and I have said that the body is not more than the soul.' 'I swear I think there is nothing but immortality, that the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it, and the cohering is for it!' If these are not all exact quotations, every one will recognise them as genuine types. No style lends itself more readily to parody and burlesque. But when he is at his best the mannerism is in a great measure shaken off.</p><p>The disregard of metrical uniformity is another fact which is observed by the most superficial reader, and probably repels him, but with far less reason than the points above mentioned. It is not indeed correct to say that 'there is no trace of rhyme or metre' in these poems. There is at least one poem which affords an instance of perfectly regular metre and rhyme throughout, and in another the regularity in these respects is all but complete; while in some others, such as 'Pioneers' and the 'Dirge for two Veterans,' though there is no rhyme nor an absolute uniformity in the length of lines, there is a stanzaic uniformity, which satisfies, or almost satisfies, the conventional expectations. As for the rest, some is quite formless; but for the most part there is a strongly marked and characteristic rhythm, not strictly metrical, though with metrical tendencies, nor properly to be called the rhythm of prose. It has rather the monotony of a chant than the varied tones of the best rhythmical prose, though it must be said that it not only resembles but is identical with the early prose rhythm of the same author.‡ Every reader of the preface before us will perceive this; and we are relieved from the possibility of doubt by the fact that passages from this preface have been introduced word for word, or with insignificant changes, into subsequently published poems, being divided stichometrically into lines by the natural pauses of the sentence. The words which he himself uttered in this preface on the subject of the rhythmical uniformity are among the best which have been spoken on that subject yet, and no apology is needed for quoting them.</p><p>The poetic quality is not marshalled in rhyme or uniformity. . . . but is the life of these and much else, and is in the soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme, and of uniformity that it conveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme and the uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of material laws, and bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs and roses on a bush, and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts, and oranges, and melons, and pears, and shed the perfume impalpable to form. The fluency and ornaments of the finest poems, or music, or orations, or recitations are not independent but dependent. . . . Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost.</p><p>It has been said already that though Whitman's lines are not ordinarily metrical, yet they have metrical tendencies, and this will readily be perceived by any one who reads them aloud. The prevailing rhythm is dactylic. Every reader of Whitman will recognise as characteristic the following examples, chosen purely to illustrate the movement:—</p><p>Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;<br>When you, my son and my comrade, dropt at my side that day,<br>One look I but gave, which your dear eyes return'd with a look I shall never forget;<br>One touch of your hand to mine, O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the ground,<br>Then onward I sped in the battle. . . .</p><p>Or again—</p><p>It is well—against such I say not a word, I am their poet also;<br>But behold such swiftly subside, burnt up for Religion's sake;<br>For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential life of the earth,<br>Any more than such are to Religion.</p><p>Not unseldom we find regular or slightly irregular hexameters, sometimes several in succession, and occasionally also pentameters, e.g.—</p><p>Do you not know, O speech, how the buds beneath you are folded?</p><p>Or,</p><p>Borne through the smoke of the battles, and pierced with missiles I saw them,<br>And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody.</p><p>Or again (an elegiac couplet)—</p><p>Chants going forth from the centre, from Kansas, and thence equidistant<br>Shooting in pulses of fire, ceaseless, to vivify all.</p><p>But these are accidents. Let me call the reader's attention to one form of this rhythm which is doubtless the result of design, the occasional lengthening of line in passionate lyrical outbursts, which produces sometimes a remarkable effect of intensity in that it 'crowds and hurries and precipitates' the notes in the eagerness as it were of the verse to find a cadence.</p><p>Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again, if you only would.</p><p>From these dactylics we pass to the inspiriting trochaics of 'Pioneers,' and finally, as the poet grows graver in the more deeply spiritual songs of the soul and of death, which are among his last productions, with the rapid flow of the earlier rhythm mingles the graver tone of the iambic, as in the remarkable poem called 'Passage to India.'</p><p>Passage indeed, O soul, to primal thought,<br>Not lands and seas alone, thy own clear freshness,<br>The young maturity of brood and bloom,<br>To realms of budding bibles.</p><p>Or again, in the still more recent 'Song of the Redwood Tree'—</p><p>Nor yield we mournfully, majestic brothers,<br>We who have grandly filled our time;<br>With nature's calm content, with tacit huge delight,<br>We welcome what we wrought for through the past,<br>And leave the field for them.</p><p>But enough of the outward form; it is time that we examine more closely the value of the contents.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>If we were asked for justification of the high estimate of this poet, which has been implied, if not expressed, in what has been hitherto said, the answer would be perhaps first, that he has a power of passionate expression, of strong and simple utterance of the deepest tones of grief, which is almost or altogether without its counterpart in the world. Not often has he exerted his power, but often enough to let us understand that he possesses it, and to stamp him as a poet inferior to few, if any, of our time in strength of native genius, however he may fall behind many in artistic perception. Two poems of death, indicated often by himself as the highest theme, though not faultless, for none of his work is so, are enough in themselves to rest his claim upon. The first is 'Out of the Cradle endlessly rocking;' and the other that funeral hymn for President Lincoln which begins, 'When Lilacs last in the Door-yard bloomed.' Nothing illustrates more strongly than these two poems the intense sympathy of the writer with nature, animate and inanimate, and the deep emotional significance which it has for him. Both are saturated with influences of sky, sea, or forest. The first is of the ocean, whose husky meaning is a fit accompaniment to the song of desolate loneliness; the second is of the forest, whose pine-fragrance is as the perfume of the sweet soul that is gone. In both the most passionate outpourings come forth in the notes of birds—the mocking-bird, the most magnificent of songsters, and the hermit thrush, the grey-brown minstrel of the cedar swamp, lyrical mourners whose chant is fused and translated into words by the ecstatic listener. Shelley's skylark pours forth a harmonious madness of joy, Keats' nightingale seems to be intoxicated with passionate yearning; but never before has a bird poured forth to a poet a song so capable of stirring the depths of emotion in the heart, as heart-breaking indeed in its intensity of grief, as that of the lone singer 'on the prong of a moss-scalloped stake, down almost among the slapping waves.' The burden of the first division of the chant is 'Two together.'</p><p>Shine! shine! shine!<br>Pour down your warmth, great sun!<br>While we bask, we two together.<br>Two together!<br>Winds blow south, or winds blow north,<br>Day come white or night come black,<br>Home, or rivers and mountains from home,<br>Singing all time, minding no time,<br>While we two keep together.</p><p>Such is the joyous and careless song of the two feathered guests on the seashore of Paumánok, when the snows had melted and the lilac scent was in the air, while every day the boy, curious but never disturbing them, peered cautiously at the he-bird flitting to and fro, and the she-bird 'crouch'd on her nest, silent with bright eyes,' till on a sudden, 'may-be killed unknown to her mate,' she disappeared, nor returned that day nor the next, nor ever appeared again. And thenceforward all the summer, day and night over the surging of the fierce mother the sea, the boy hears at intervals the solitary one who is left.</p><p>Blow! blow! blow!<br>Blow up, sea winds, along Paumánok's shore,<br>I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me.</p><p>Often the child, gliding down to the beach, had stood with bare feet, the wind wafting his hair, with 'the white arms out in the breaker tirelessly tossing,' to listen and translate the notes of the demon or bird.</p><p>Soothe! soothe! soothe!<br>Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,<br>And again another behind, embracing and lapping, every one close,<br>But my love soothes not me, not me.<br>Low hangs the moon, it rose late,<br>It is lagging—O I think it is heavy with love, with love.<br>O madly the sea pushes upon the land,<br>With love, with love.<br>O night! do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers?<br>What is that little black thing I see there in the white?<br>Loud! loud! loud!<br>Loud I call to you, my love!<br>High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves.<br>Surely you must know who is here, is here,<br>You must know who I am, my love.<br>Low-hanging moon!<br>What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?<br>O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!<br>O moon, do not keep her from me any longer.<br>Land! land, O land!<br>Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again, if you only would,<br>For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.</p><p>———</p><p>But soft! sink low!<br>Soft! let me just murmur,<br>And do you wait a moment, you husky-noised sea,<br>For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me,<br>So faint, I must be still, be still to listen,<br>But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me.<br>Hither, my love!<br>Here I am! here!<br>With this just-sustained note I announce myself to you,<br>This gentle call is for you, my love, for you.<br>Do not be decoyed elsewhere,<br>That is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice;<br>That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray;<br>Those are the shadows of the leaves.<br>O darkness! O in vain!<br>O I am very sick and sorrowful.</p><p>———</p><p>O past! O happy life! O songs of joy!<br>In the air, in the woods, over fields,<br>Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!<br>But my mate no more, no more with me!<br>We two together no more.</p><p>It stirs the boy's heart, and he feels that it is toward him and not really toward its mate that the bird sings, and a thousand echoes have started to life in his soul.</p><p>O give me the clew! (It lurks in the night here somewhere),<br>O if I am to have so much, let me have more!<br>Whereto answering, the sea,<br>Delaying not, hurrying not,<br>Whispered me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,<br>Lisped to me the low and delicious word death,<br>And again death, death, death, death,<br>Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous'd child's heart,<br>But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,<br>Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over,<br>Death, death, death, death, death.</p><p>This is the only solution of the cries of unsatisfied love, and here lies the highest problem which awaits the poet always with its unconquerable, almost unassailable, mysteriousness. This word it is which he gives as the key to the thousand responsive songs awakened in him from that hour, the word which the sea whispered, 'like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet garments, bending aside.'§ 'Whispers of Heavenly Death' is the title of one section of these poems, and it is the 'Carol of Death' which forms the centre of the second of the two poems to which attention has not been called. Splendidly imaginative is this 'nocturne,' with its three ever-recurring chords, 'lilac, and star, and bird.' Of more intricate construction than the other and less directly passionate, because expressive of a more reflecting sorrow, it is yet a composition which few can read or hear unmoved.</p><p>Ever-returning Spring, trinity sure to me you bring,<br>Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,<br>And thought of him I love.</p><p>The star is disappearing in the black murk of clouds, while cruel hands hold him powerless; but his senses are steeped in the perfume of the lilac and the song from secluded recesses, 'death's outlet song of life,' of the singer among the cedars, while 'over the breast of the spring,' through lanes and through streets of cities,</p><p>Passing the yellowspear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark brown fields uprisen,<br>Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards,<br>Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,<br>Night and day journeys a coffin.<br><p>To the coffin that slowly passes, with the great cloud darkening the land, with the people's mourning and 'the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,' he brings a sprig with its flower broken from the lilac bush, with its delicate blossoms and heart-shaped leaves. Nor for this coffin alone, but for all he would bring blossoms and branches and chant a song 'for you, O sane and sacred Death.' This, after all, was what the great star must have meant a month since—</p><p>As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night,<br>As you drooped from the sky low down as if to my side, while the other stars all look'd on,<br>As we wander'd together the solemn night (for something, I know not what, kept me from sleep).</p><p>But he is drawn by the song of the bird, though for a moment he lingers, detained by the star, his departing comrade, and by the mastering odour of the lilac. Sea winds blown from east and west, from the Atlantic and from the Pacific, shall be the perfume for the grave of the man he loves. Pictures of growing spring 'with flood of the yellow gold of the gorgeous indolent sinking sun,' of all the scenes of life in country or city of this varied and ample land, these shall adorn his burial house. But over all these falls the dark cloud,</p><p>And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.<br>Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,<br>And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,<br>And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions,<br>I fled forth to the hiding receiving night, that talks not,<br>Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,<br>To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.</p><p>The bird sang the 'Carol of Death.'</p><p>Prais'd be the fathomless universe,<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,<br>And for love, sweet love—but praise! praise! praise!<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.</p><p>The hearer stands rapt by the charm and holding as if by the hand his mystic companions, while the sight that was bound in his eyes 'unclosed, as to long panoramas of visions.' He sees the vision of armies, of battle flags borne through the smoke, of the corpses of all the slain soldiers of the war, and he sees that they were not as had been thought.</p><p>They themselves were fully at rest, they suffered not;<br>The living remained and suffer'd.</p><p>Passing from the visions and from the song, he unlooses the hold of his comrades' hands, and leaves the cedars and the lilac with heart-shaped leaves; yet each and all he keeps.</p><p>The song, the wondrous chant of the grey-brown bird,<br>And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,<br>With the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of woe,<br>With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,<br>Comrades mine, and I in the midst, and their memory ever I keep, for the dead I loved so well,<br>For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands—and this for his dear sake,<br>Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,<br>There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>The passage from the region of pure imagination and passion to the other works of the same writer compels us to deal with his religious and political philosophy. In religion, if he is to be labelled with a name, it must be perhaps 'Pantheist;' he is an exponent of 'Cosmic Emotion.' 'I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand not God in the least.' It is the contemplation of 'the fathomless universe,' and all its movements and rests, its organic and inorganic existences, which stirs the religious emotion in his soul. Men are inclined to cry, 'What is this separate nature so unnatural? What is this earth to our affections? (unloving earth without a throb to answer ours, cold earth, the place of graves).' To answer this question is the function of the poet, to soothe 'the sad incessant refrain, Wherefore, unsatisfied soul? and Whither, O mocking Life?' His answer is, 'Bathe in the Spirit of the Universe, intoxicate thyself with God.'</p><p>Thoughts, silent thoughts, of Time, and Space, and Death, like waters flowing,<br>Bear me indeed as through the regions infinite,<br>Whose air I breathe, whose ripples bear, lave me all over,<br>Bathe me, O God, in thee, mounting to thee,<br>I and my soul to range in range of thee,<br>O Thou transcendent,<br>Nameless, the fibre and the breath,<br>Light of the light, shedding forth universes. . . .<br>Thou pulse, thou motive of the stars, suns, systems,<br>That, circling, move in order, safe, harmonious,<br>Athwart the shapeless vastnesses of space,<br>How should I think, how breathe a single breath, how speak, if out of myself<br>I could not launch to those superior universes?</p><p>God, as he includes all, includes personality, and from God will come somehow a satisfaction of the longing of the soul. What conclusions, if any, are to be drawn from the alteration in the new edition of the poem called 'Gods,' I leave it to the curious to consider; but in it clearly, as elsewhere, we find anticipation of the</p><p>Lover divine, and perfect comrade,<br>Waiting content, invisible yet, but certain,</p><p>of whom, whether he be ideal or real, we cannot pronounce.</p><p>About immortality he doubts, yet strongly believes. In moments of cool reflection he feels that the questions of 'identity beyond the grave' is the great unsolved problem. Yet his poetical optimism continually leads him to assert immortality, and that not merely the merging of our life in the vital forces of the universe, though that is sometimes his meaning, but actual personal identity of the human soul after death. We have, on the one hand, among his first utterances—</p><p>I bequeath myself to the dirt, to grow from the grass I love;</p><p>and, on the other hand, we have later the picture of the chamber of death, where</p><p>The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,<br>But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously on the corpse;</p><p>and again the cry—</p><p>If maggots and rats ended us, then alarum! for we are betrayed,<br>Then indeed suspicion of death.</p><p>On the whole he seems to become more definite as he proceeds, in his anticipation of 'identity after the grave.' As for defined creeds, it is not they which give the life;</p><p>Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth, than they are shed out of you.</p><p>God and the soul are not to be argued about;</p><p>Logic and sermons never convinces;<br>The damp of the night strikes deeper into my soul.</p><p>But religion is the thing above all, and he rarely fails to point the way to spiritual meanings.</p><p>His morality is almost comprised in the one word 'health,' health of body and health of soul, the healthy and sane man to be the ultimate standard. These are Greek ethics, and the maxim on which they seem to be based—</p><p>Whatever tastes sweet to the most perfect person, that is finally right—</p><p>is thoroughly Aristotelian. A 'sane sensuality,' as it is called by one of his friends, is a necessary part of the ideal man. The body is sacred as well as the soul, and to assert is sacredness is the purpose of his sometimes outrageous physiological details, which can hardly have the desired effect, but are clearly not meant, nor indeed adapted, to minister to vicious tastes; they may disgust, but they can hardly corrupt. There is indeed something in this tearing away of veils which, however justly it may offend true modesty, is to unhealthiness and pruriency as sunlight and the open air; they shrink from the exposure, and shiver at the healthy freshness; it is not an atmosphere in which they can long survive: mystery is the region in which they thrive, and here all mystery is rudely laid bare. This man's nature is itself as healthy as the sea, which endangers not us with all the fevers deposited in it.</p><p>His judgment of actions is rather aesthetic than strictly moral, and he admires the unconscious blossoming out of good and kindly deeds more than all the moral struggles which proceed from religious introspection. He envies the careless rectitude of the movements of animals who are placid and self-contained, and do not 'sweat and whine about their condition.' He is sure that good deeds have their happiness in themselves and not in any external or future reward, and that bad deeds have their misery in themselves and not in any external or future punishment.</p><p>The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him;<br>The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him;<br>The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him;<br>The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him;<br>The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him, it cannot fail.</p><p>And again of a future life—</p><p>I have dreamed that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of us changed;<br>I have dreamed that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present and past law,<br>And that murderers, drunkards, and liars shall be under the present and past law,<br>For I have dreamed that the law they are under now is enough.</p><p>But underlying all, so far as he himself is concerned, is a sympathy embracing all human beings, however vile, and all animals and plants, however irresponsive. It is this which leads him at times to emphasise his own sensuality, that he may make himself the equal of the most depraved, to draw them if it may be in the bonds of sympathy to himself. It is this which is the open secret of that magnetic influence which he is said to exercise over those whom he casually meets. It was this which led him to the hospitals rather than to the field of battle, and makes him recall in memory now the experiences of the 'Dresser,' rather than the great battles and sieges at which he was present. No study of the poet would be complete which did not include the section of his work which deals with the war and after, which indeed contains some of the most magnificent and spirit-stirring trumpet-blasts, as well as some of the most deeply-moving aspects of suffering and death ever expressed by poet. Here was a great theme, and he treated it nobly; with all notes of patriotism and devotion to the flag is beautifully blended sympathy for the vanquished, and deep desire to relieve the sufferings of the wounded. On the whole no part of his work is more interesting than this; it is as if he were the born poet of emancipation, tender to all suffering persons, yet with nerve strong enough to endure without fainting or shrieking the stroke of necessary surgery. Magnificent is his war cry, as in the 'Song of the Banner at Daybreak,' and his note of triumph, 'The war is completed, the price is paid, the title settled beyond recall;' yet finer still is the 'Vigil on the Field of Battle,' the memories of the hospital tent with its long row of cots, the vision of the Mother of All gazing desperate on her dead, the reflection on those 'Camps of Green' where friend and foe without hatred sleep, and need not any longer provide for outposts, nor word for the countersign, nor drummer to beat the morning drum. Other things, too, he gathered from the experiences of the war: he gathered from them more than from all else the steadfastness of his belief in democracy, in the nobleness and courage of common men. But to speak of this would belong rather to a review of the Democratic Vistas, which is not my task; the poetical aspects of the theme are enough. The poet then believes in the power of sympathy, but he believes also in individuality 'underneath all—individuals.' At least half his work is devoted to the assertion of this, and yet with this sympathy and 'adhesiveness' is to go hand in hand, and he has as his watchword still the word of democracy, the word En-masse. The reconciliation is to be found in the prose more clearly than in the verse, but Whitman is not over-anxious for reconciliation; he is large, he contains multitudes, and has room for contradictions.</p><p>Do I contradict myself?<br>Very well then, I contradict myself.</p><p>That being so, his optimism is the more comprehensible; and it is upon a basis of optimism after all that he builds his whole religion and philosophy. He has too firm a grasp of fact to ignore the existence of evil. If he exclaims at times, 'There is no evil,' he adds, 'or if there is, it is just as important to you as anything else.' 'I am not the poet of goodness only; I am just as much the poet of evil.' But he believes that evil is transient and relative; he holds that the drift of things is towards good; that all is, not at once, but finally for the best. This he said, in plain prose, is the growing conviction of his life, and in verse, of the souls of men and women going forward along the roads of the universe,</p><p>They go, they go, I know that they go, but I know not where they go,<br>But I know that they go forward toward the best.</p><p>This it is which makes him so much at peace about God and about death. 'No array of words can describe how much I am at peace about God and about death;' the heroic failures of this world are to him eternal successes. 'Battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won;' therefore, 'Vivas to those who have failed!' And above all the cause of liberty will finally succeed.</p><p>Revolt! and still revolt! revolt!</p><p>———</p><p>When liberty goes out of a place, it is not the first to go nor the second or third to go,<br>It waits for all the rest to go, it is the last.<br>When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,<br>And when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged from any part of the earth,<br>Then only shall liberty, or the idea of liberty, be discharged from that part of the earth,<br>And the infidel come into full possession.</p><p>Too much, perhaps, has been said of the religion and morality of the poet, and too little of the literary aspect of his works. But this it is difficult to illustrate sufficiently by quotation, and impossible to set forth without illustration. It seemed to me that suggestions of the drift of the whole were more likely to be useful than attention to particular points. Everyone will remark first the too frequent infelicity of sentiment and phrase, and then the striking directness of utterance, and the stumbling, as if by accident, on the absolutely best words in the absolutely best order, which characterises his finest work. Whether these be truly poems, or fine imaginings only, we need not be much concerned to inquire. His own claim to be the poet of America is based on other than purely literary grounds.</p><p>Give me the pay I have served for,<br>Give me to sing the songs of the great Idea, take all the rest.<br>I have loved the earth, sun, animals; I have despised riches;<br>I have given alms to everyone that asked….<br>I have dismissed whatever insulted my own soul or defiled me body,<br>Claimed nothing to myself which I have not carefully claimed for others on the same terms,<br>Sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every state,<br>(Upon this breast has many a dying soldier leaned to breathe his last).</p><p>———</p><p>Say, O mother, have I not to your thought been faithful?<br>Have I not through life kept you and yours before me?</p><p>G.C. MACAULAY.</p><p>———</p><p>* Leaves of Grass. By Walt Whitman. London, David Bogue, 1881. Leaves of Grass. Preface to the original edition, 1855. London, Trübner & Co., 1881.</p><p>† The title 'Walt Whitman,' which this poem has originally borne in American editions, is now altered to 'Song of Myself.'</p><p>‡It should be observed that in the later prose of Democratic Vistas, a book which is comparatively free from his characteristic weaknesses, the writer attains to a prose style of much greater excellence. This book, with its Carlylian eloquence and anti-Carlylian optimism, is not more remarkable on account of the robust faith of the writer in the future of American Democracy, than on account of his keen perception and vigorous denunciation of its present faults and failings, and is enough by itself to stamp him as a master of the English language and a prose poet of the first order. The English reader who would understand the author's drift and hear the key-note of his philosophy could not do better than begin with this book, but that it is in England almost unobtainable.</p><p>§ A line added in this edition.</p><p> Rees Welsh & Co., Philadelphia, have published a volume of Walt Whitman's prose, under the title, Specimen Days and Collect. Externally it bears a close resemblance to Leaves of Grass, but the likeness does not run through. The strong animalism of this astonishing author seems to be thoroughly aroused only under the influence of the muse; and though it is plain enough even when he writes in the prose form, it is not then offensive. We are inclined to suspect that a better test of his intrinsic quality will be found in these random and fugitive papers, some of them recording his experiences as a hospital nurse, many gathered from the pages of periodicals, than in the wilder and less genuine strains in which he has been accustomed to shout for the edification of feather-brained disciples. There is little in these confessions, communings with nature, forcible and often original descriptions of common-place objects, which can very well stir the enthusiasm of the howling dervishes of the new criticism; but there is a certain freshness and individuality which are always impressive, and an imaginative quality which sometimes rises very near the level of poetry if it does not reach it. And yet that Whitman has any new message to deliver to the world, that life, literature, philosophy have anything to gain from his thoughts, no perfectly sane person is likely to decide after a reading of his prose. In the 'Pieces in Early Youth' reprinted with the miscellania called Collect, it is apparent that Whitman once wrote very much like other people. </p><p><strong>WHITMAN'S NEW BOOK.</strong></p><p>———</p><p><strong>The Prose Writings of the 'Good Gray Poet.'</strong></p><p>———</p><p><strong>A Twin Volume to 'Leaves of Grass.'</strong></p><p>———</p><p><strong>A Striking and Interesting Collection of a Lifetime.</strong></p><p>———</p><p>Walt Whitman's new book, with the odd, but thoroughly characteristic and descriptive title, 'Specimen Days and Collect,' is a prose companion to 'Leaves of Grass,' being a complete collection of the author's prose writings, as the former comprises all his verse. It is a meaty, compact volume, and is more directly comprehensible to the understanding of the multitude than the greater and more famous work. And yet this is as much Whitman as his verse is, and the same characteristics pervade it: grand healthiness of tone, largeness of view, universal reach, and, at the same time, deliberate perception and sensitiveness, and identity with nature, indissoluble and knit through and through with its fabric. Had 'Leaves of Grass' never been written this book alone would be enough to establish the author's fame as a great poet. In a personal letter Whitman writes:</p> <p>It is a great jumble (as man himself is)—is an autobiography after its sort—(sort 'o synonymous with Montaigne, and Rousseau's 'Confessions', etc.)—is the gathering up and formulation and putting in identity of the wayside itemizings, memoranda and personal notes of 50 years under modern American conditions—a good deal helter-skelter, but, I am sure, with a certain sort of orbic compaction and oneness as the final result. It dwells long on the secession war, gives glimpses of that event's strange interiors, especially the army hospitals; in fact, makes the resuscitation and putting on record of the emotional aspect of the war of 1861-65 one of its principal features.</p> <p>Indeed, too much stress cannot be laid upon this phase of the book. No history or description of the war that has yet been written probably gives such vivid and graphic pictures of its events—its heroism, its horror, its sadness, the pathetic tenderness of countless of its incidents, and, above all, its grand significance. For this reason it ought to be dear to every soldier. During the years from 1876 to the present date Whitman has been a partial paralytic. Very much of his days (and nights, also, it appears) he has spent in the open air down in the country in the woods and fields, and by a secluded little New Jersey river. His memoranda, on the spot, of these days and nights, fill a goodly portion of the volume. Then comes the Collect, embodying 'Democratic Vistas,' the noble prose preface to Leaves of Grass of the edition of 1855, and much other prose, together with a number of youthful efforts in prose and poetry, which, in a note, the author explains he would have preferred to have them quietly dropped in oblivion, but, to avoid the annoyance of their surreptitious issue, he has, with some qualms, tacked them on. The whole volume, in its arrangement, is pregnant with Whitman's personality, and it seems more a part of its author than paper and printers' ink usually do. It also exhibits, as far as possible for any public record, that most wonderful and intricate of processes, the working of a poet's mind, and affords an insight into the mysterious interior depths and rambling galleries and chambers of the cosmic sphere whose large and rugged exterior is clothed with the fresh beauty of leaves of grass.</p> <p>The contents of the book take a wide range, as may be seen by the following samples: The old Whitman and Van Velsor Cemeteries…Paumanok (Long Island, N. Y.) and My Life on It as Child and Young Man…Printing Office—Old Brooklyn…Lafayette…Broadway Sights…My Passion for Ferries…Omnibus Jaunts and Drivers…Plays and Operas…Opening of the Secession War…Down at the Front…The Army Hospitals…Cases…Preparations for Visits…A New York Soldier…A Yankee Antique…Two Brothers, one South, one North…the Grand Review… New Themes Entered upon (1876-'80)…to the Spring and Brook…A July Afternoon by the Pond…Locusts and Katydids…Full Starr'd Nights…Mulleins…A Sun-Bath—Nakedness…Human and Heroic New York…Hours for the Soul…Delaware River—Days and Nights…Scenes on the Ferry…Begin a Long Jaunt West…Missouri, Kansas, Colorado…The Prairies, and an Undelivered Speech…Denver Impressions…The Spanish Peaks—Evening on the Plains…the Arkansas…The Silent General…the Women of the West…St. Louis…Edgar Poe's Significance…Loafing in the Woods…Jaunting through Canada…the Saguenay…Capes Eternity and Trinity…Carlyle from American Points of View…A Week in Boston…Collect…Democratic Vistas…Prefaces to 'Leaves of Grass,' l855, 1872, 1876…Poetry Today in America…Death of Abraham Lincoln…Stories and Sketches Written in Youth (1834-1842).</p> <p>In 'Specimen Days' there is a vein of playfulness, and a humor—if it may be called so—probably different from anything yet in literature. The following is an example of this quality, and it is also an excellent characterization of the book:</p><p><strong>CEDAR PLUMS LIKE—NAMES.</strong></p><p>One time I thought of naming this collection 'Cedar-Plums Like' (which I still fancy wouldn't have been a bad name, nor inappropriate.) A melange of loafing, looking, hobbying, sitting, traveling—a little thinking thrown in for salt but very little—not only summer but all seasons—not only days but nights—some literary meditations—books, authors examined, Carlyle, Poe, Emerson tried (always under my cedar tree, in the open air, and never in the library)—mostly the scenes everybody sees, but some of my own caprices, meditations, egotism—truly an open air and mainly summer formation—singly or in clusters—wild and free and somewhat acrid—indeed more like cedar plums than you might guess at first glance.</p> <p>But do you know what they are? (To city man, or some sweet parlor lady, I now talk.) As you go along roads, or barrens, or across country, anywhere through these states, middle, eastern, western or southern, you will see, certain seasons of the year, the thick woody tufts of the cedar mottled with bunches of china-blue berries, about as big as fox grapes. But first a special word for the tree itself; everybody knows that the cedar is a healthy, cheap, democratic wood, streaked red and white—an evergreen—that it is not a cultivated tree—that it keeps away moths—that it grows inland or seaboard, all climates, hot or cold, any sort—in fact, rather prefers sand and bleak side spots content if the plough and fertilizer and the trimming axe will but keep away and let it alone. After a long rain, when everything looks bright, often have I stopt in my wood saunters, south or north, or far west, to take in its dusky green washed clean and sweet, and specked copiously with its fruit of clear, hardy blue. The wood of the cedar is of use—but what profit on earth are those sprigs of acrid plums? A question impossible to answer satisfactorily. True, some of the herb doctors give them for stomache affections, but the remedy is as bad as the disease. Then, in my rambles down in Camden county, I once found an old crazy woman gathering the clusters with zeal and joy. She showed, as I was told afterward, a sort of infatuation for them, and every year placed and kept profuse bunches high and low about her room. They had a strange charm about her uneasy head, and effected docility and peace. (She was harmless, and lived near by with her well-off married daughter.) Whether there is any connection between these bunches and being out of one's wits I cannot say, but I myself entertain a weakness for them. Indeed, I love the cedar, anyhow—its naked ruggedness, its just palpable odor (so different from the perfumer's best), its silence, its equable acceptance of winter's cold and summer's heat, of rain or drought, its shelter to me from those, at times, its associations (well, I never could explain why I love anybody or anything). The service I now specially owe to the cedar is, while I cast around for a name for my proposed collection, hesitating, puzzled—after rejecting a long, long string, I lift my eyes, and lo; the very term I want. At any rate, I go no further—I tire in the search. I take what some invisible kind spirit has put before me. Besides, who shall say there is not affinity enough between (at least the bundle of sticks that produced) many of these pieces or granulations and those blue berries? Their lusciousness growing wild—a certain aroma of nature I would so like to have in my pages—the thing soft whence they come—their content in being let alone—their stolid and deaf repugnance to answering questions (this latter the nearest, dearest trait affinity of all). Then, reader dear, in conclusion, as to the point of the name for the present collection, let us be satisfied to have a name—something to identify and bind it together, to concrete all its vegetable, mineral, personal memoranda, abrupt raids of criticism, crude gossip of philosophy, varied sands and clumps—without bothering ourselves because certain pages do not present themselves to you or me as coming under their own name with entire fitness or amiability. (It is a profound, vexatious, never-explicable matter—this of names. I have been exercised deeply about it my whole life.)</p><p>After all of which the name 'Cedar-Plums Like' got its nose put out of joint; but I cannot afford to throw away what I pencil'd down the lane there, under the shelter of my old friend, one warm October noon. Besides, it wouldn't be civil to the cedar tree.</p><p>The parts that deal with the war have been emphasized as forming one of the most important phases of the work. Here is an incident from the author's war experience which gives a better glance into the secession contest than all the formal military reports and statistics of the period:</p><p><strong>A YANKEE ANTIQUE.</strong></p><p>March 27, 1885. Sergt. Calvin F. Harlowe, company C. 29th Massachusetts, 3d brigade, 1st division, 9th corps—a mark'd sample of heroism and death (some may say bravado, but I say heroism, of grandest, oldest order)—in the late attack by the rebel troops, and temporary capture by them, of Fort Steadman, at night. The fort was surprised at dead of night. Suddenly awaken'd from their sleep, and rushing from their tents, Harlowe, with others, found himself in the hands of the secesh—they demanded his surrender—he answered: 'Never while I live.' (Of course it was useless. The others surrender'd; the odds were too great.) Again he was ask'd to yield, this time by a rebel captain. Though surrounded, and quite calm, he again refused, call'd sternly to his comrades to fight on, and himself attempted to do so. The rebel captain then shot him—but at the same instant he shot the captain. Both fell together mortally wounded. Harlowe died almost instantly. The rebels were driven out in a very short time. The body was buried next day, but soon taken up and sent home (Plymouth county, Mass.). Harlowe was only 22 years of age—was a tall, slim, dark-hair'd, blue-eyed young man—had come out originally with the 29th; and that is the way he met his death after four years' campaign. He was in the seven days' fight before Richmond, in second Bull Run, Antietam, first Fredericksburg, Vicksburg, Jackson, Wilderness, and the campaigns following-was as good a soldier as ever wore the blue, and every old officer in the regiment will bear that testimony. Though so young, and in a common rank, he had a spirit as resolute and brave as any hero for the books, ancient or modern; it was too great to say 'I surrender'—and so he died. (When I think of such things, knowing them well, all the vast and complicated events of the war, on which history dwells and makes its volumes, fall aside, and for the moment at any rate I see nothing but young Calvin Harlowe’s figure in the night, disdaining to surrender.)</p><p><strong>LITERARY CRITICISM.</strong></p><p>There are many scattered dashes of poetic and literary criticism, evidently negligent and impromptu. On one of the concluding pages, for instance, the following:</p> <p>LI tried to read a beautifully printed and scholarly volume on 'the Theory of Poetry' received by mail this morning from England—but gave it up at last for a bad job. Here are some capricious pencillings that followed, as I find them in my notes</p> <p>In youth and maturity poems are charged with sunshine and varied pomp of the day, but as the soul more and more takes precedence (the sensuous still included), the dusk becomes the poet's atmosphere. I, too, have sought, and ever seek, the brilliant sun, and make my songs according. But, as I grow old, the half-lights of evening are far more to me.</p> <p>The play of imagination, with the sensuous objects of nature for symbols, and faith—with love and pride as the unseen impetus and moving power of all, make up the curious chess game of a poem.</p> <p>Common teachers or critics are always asking: 'What does it mean?' Symphony of the fine musician, or sunset, or sea waves rolling up the beach—what do they mean? Undoubtedly, in the most subtle elusive sense, they mean something—as love does, and religion does, and the best poem—but who shall fathom and define those meanings? I do not intend this as a warrant for wildness and frantic escapades, but to justify the soul's frequent joy in what cannot be defined to the intellectual part or to calculation:</p><p>At its best, poetic lore is like what may be heard of conversation in the dusk, from speakers near or far, of which we get only a few broken mummers. What is not gather'd is far more—perhaps the main thing.</p><p>Grandest poetic passages are only to be taken at free remove, as we sometimes look for stars at night, not by gazing directly toward them, but off one side.</p><p>(To a poetic student and friend.) I only seek to put you in rapport. Your own brain, heart, evolution, must not only understand the matter, but largely supply it.</p><p>His criticism on 'Edgar Poe's Significance' is an example of the best critical powers, and shows a high moral judgment. He says 'there is another shape of personality dearer far to the artist sense (which likes the play of strongest lights and shades), where the perfect character, the good, the heroic, although never attained, is never lost sight of, but, through failures, sorrows, temporary downfall, is return'd to again and again, and while often violated is passionately alluded to as long as mind, muscles, voice obey the power we call volition. This sort of personality we see more or less in Burns, Byron, Schiller and George Sand. But we do not see it in Edgar Poe.*** Almost without the first sign of moral principle or of the concrete or its heroisms, or the simpler affections of the heart, Poe's verses illustrate an intense faculty—for technical and abstract beauty, with the rhyming art to excess, and an incorrigible propensity toward nocturnal themes, a demoniac undertone behind every page, and, by final judgment, probably belong among the electric lights of imaginative literature, brilliant and dazzling, but with no heat.' Again, he says: 'By its popular poets the calibres of an age, the weak spots of its embankments, its subcurrents (often more significant than the biggest surface ones), are unerringly indicated. The lush and weird that have taken such extraordinary possession of 19th century verse-lovers, what mean they?'</p><p><strong>RUSSIA AND AMERICA.</strong></p><p>Occasionally throughout the book, and as notable as any parts, are some of Whitman's special letters. Here, for example, is one which tells its own story.</p><p>CAMDEN, N. J., U. S. A., Dec. 20, 1881.</p><p>To ——————(Dresden, Saxony): Your letter asking definite endorsement to your translation of my 'Leaves of Grass' into Russian is just received, and I hasten to answer it. Most warmly and willingly I consent to the translation, and wish a prayerful God speed to the enterprise.</p> <p>You Russians and we Americans! Our countries so distant, so unlike at first glance—such a difference in social and political conditions, and our respective methods or moral and practical development the last 100 years and yet in certain features, and vastest ones, so resembling each other. The variety of stock elements and tongues, to be resolutely fused in a common identity and union at all hazards—the idea, perennial through the ages—that they both have their historic and divine mission—the fervent element of manly friendship throughout the whole people, surpass'd by no other races—the grand expanse of territorial limits and boundaries—the unform'd and nebulous state of many things, not yet permanently settled, but agreed on all hands to be the preparations of an infinitely greater future—the fact that both peoples have their independent and leading positions to hold, keep, and if necessary, fight for, against the rest of the world—the deathless aspirations at the inmost center of each great community, so vehement, so mysterious, so abysmic—are certainly features you Russians and we Americans possess in common.</p> <p>As my dearest dream is for an internationality of poems and poets, binding the lands of the earth closer than all treaties and diplomacy; as the purpose beneath the rest in my book is such hearty comradeship, for individuals to begin with, and for all the nations of the earth as a result—how happy I should be to get the healing and emotional contact of the great Russian peoples.</p> <p>To whom, now and here, (addressing you for Russia and Russians, and empowering you, should you see fit, to print the present letter in your book, as a preface,) I waft affectionate salutation from these shores, in America's name.</p><p>W. W.</p><p><strong>WHITMAN AT PRESENT.</strong></p><p>The following extract from a letter to a German friend gives a picture of the poet's condition at present:</p><p>May 31, '82. From today I enter upon my 64th year. The paralysis that first affected me nearly 10 years ago has since remain'd with varying course—seems to have settled quietly down, and will probably continue. I easily tire, am very clumsy, cannot walk far; but my spirits are first-rate. I go around in public almost every day—now and then take long trips, by railroad or boat, hundreds of miles—live largely in the open air—am sunburnt and stout, (weigh 190)—keep up my activity and interest in life, people, progress and the questions of the day. About two-thirds of the time I am quite comfortable. What mentality I ever had remains entirely unaffected; though physically, I am a half-paralytic, and likely to be so, long as I live. But the principal object of my life seems to have been accomplish'd—I have the most devoted and ardent of friends and affectionate relatives—and of enemies I really make no account.</p><p>It is understood that Whitman himself considers 'Specimen Days' as the exponent and finish of his poetic work, 'Leaves of Grass'; that each of the two volumes is indispensable, in his view, to the other, and that both together finally begin and illustrate his literary scheme in the new world. Talking lately, in a half-jocular vein, to a friend, he called them his Adam and Eve, sent out in 'this garden, the world.'</p><p>The book is issued in precisely the same style as 'Leaves of Grass,' with the same cloth binding, the same butterfly on the [illegible] and the same price. It contains a faithful likeness of Whitman, in out-door attire, and sitting watching a butterfly that has lit on his finger. Since 'Leaves of Grass' was transferred to the Philadelphia house, four editions have been exhausted, and they are now on the fifth.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S NEW VOLUME.</strong></p><p>Specimen Days and Collect By WALT WHITMAN, author of 'Leaves of Grass.' Specimen Days and Collect Philadelphia: Ress, Welsh & Co. New York: R. Worthington. 12mo. cloth. pp. 374.</p><p>So painfully impressed it Mr. Whitman with the idea that every deed and experience of a man's life, nay, every sight and sound and touch and taste and smell, should be recorded that it is strange he has not sooner written his autobiography. For, although it is not easy to assert with confidence precisely what Mr. Whitman means in a poem or an essay or a volume, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that he means this volume of avowed prose to be his autobiography. He begins it with a memorandum ('mem.,' as he is fond of neglecting to write it) made 'Down in the Woods July 2, 1882,' in which he says: 'If I do it at all I must delay no longer.' 'It' presumably means to leave to a curious posterity a record of Himself and incidentally also of America—these States—Democracy—Long Island—ferry-boats, plains and the multitudinous oceanic eligibilities of this wondrous All. This purpose is more definitely explained in another sentence of this 'mem.,' if by courtesy it may be called a sentence, which will serve both as an index and as a specimen:</p><p>Incongruous and full of skips and jumps as is the huddle of diary jottings, war memoranda of 1862–65, nature notes of 1877–81, with Western and Canadian observations afterwards, all bundled up and tied by a big string, the resolution and indeed mandate comes to me this day, this hour—(and what a day! what an hour just passing! the luxury of riant gloss and blowing breeze with all the shows of sun and sky and perfect temperature never before so filling me body and soul)—to go home, untie the bundle, reel out diary scraps and memoranda just as they are, large or small, one after another, into print-pages, and let the melange's lackings and wants of connection take care of themselves.</p><p>'Maybe, if I don't do anything else,' he says, and he might have omitted the doubting and conditional phrases, 'I shall send out the most wayward, spontaneous, fragmentary book ever printed ∗ ∗ ∗ without any definite purpose that can be told in a statement.' Following this introduction is a slovenly sketch of his life. In a semi-Biblical fashion he writes out the genealogy of the Whitmans and of the Van Velsors (his mother's family), both of which for several generations lived on Long Island. 'Out from these arrieres of persons and scenes, I was born May 31, 1819. ∗ ∗ ∗ The successive growth-stages of my infancy, childhood, youth and manhood were all pass'd on Long Island, which I sometimes feel as if I had incorporated.' He spent these years 'absorbing fields, shores, marine incidents, characters, the bay-men, farmers, pilots—always had a plentiful acquaintance with the latter and with fishermen—went every summer on sailing trips—always liked the bare sea-beach, south side, and have some of my happiest hours on it to this day.' His father, who was a carpenter, moved to Brooklyn and the boy was employed for a time in a lawyer's office. 'Clarke's, Fulton street, near Orange.' Afterwards he became a printer and did work for several newspapers. In 1849 he worked his way to New Orleans and was employed first as a printer and later for a short time as editor of the Crescent. He was once editor of the Brooklyn Eagle, but 'the trouble in the Democratic party broke forth about those times (1848–49) and I split off with the Radicals, which led to rows with the boss and 'the party,' and I lost my place.' During these years of life as a journalist in Brooklyn and New York (for he did not remain long in New Orleans) he developed his passion for ferries. 'Indeed I have always had a passion for ferries; to me they afford inimitable, streaming, never-failing, living poems.' He had a passion also for omnibus drivers. He fills half a page with the names of the drivers whom he remembers and tells of his delight in declaiming Homer (Pope's Homer!) and Shakespeare from the top of a stage while he was going up Broadway. 'The influence of those Broadway omnibus jaunts and drivers and declamations and escapades undoubtedly enter'd into the gestation of 'Leaves of Grass.'' Soon after the war began he went to Washington and remained in the hospitals there and in Virginia until the war ended. Then he secured a subordinate appointment in the Government service and filled it for several years. Stricken with paralysis, he retired to Camden, N.J., where he has since resided. He has visited Boston and the principal cities in Canada and in the West. While in the West he wrote for the Jimplecute. Extracts from his war diary and from his notes taken 'down in the woods' in New Jersey and during his journey through Canada and the West make up the 'Specimen Days.' The 'Collect' consists of his essay on America—these States—Democracy—&c., &c., &c. (to quote his own favorite phrase), and critical essays on Carlyle, Emerson, Lincoln and other men and on literary subjects, the most of which have before been printed in the periodicals. An appendix contains a few early tales and poems.</p><p>The hospital notes are printed in the slovenly shape in which they were written in his diary. Scenes at deathbeds, reflections on war, descriptions of wounds and essays on moonlight are all jumbled together. The book is not even divided into chapters. In these pages of blood and slang, of slaughtered men and sentences, of egotism and heroic endurance are a few splendid thoughts. the following are fair specimens of good and of bad:</p><p>No formal general's report nor book in the library, nor columns in the paper, embalms the bravest. North or South, East or West. Unnamed, unknown, remain, and still remain, the bravest soldiers. ∗ ∗ ∗ Likely, the typic one of them (standing, no doubt, for hundreds, thousands,) crawls aside to some bush-clump or ferny tuft on receiving his death-shot—there sheltering a little while, soaking roots, grass and soil with red blood—the battle advances, retreats, flits from the scene, sweeps by—and there, happily with pain and suffering (yet less, far less, than is supposed) the last lethargy winds like a serpent round him—the eyes glaze in death—none recks—perhaps the burial-squads, in truce, a week afterwards, search not the secluded spot—and there, at last, the Bravest Soldier crumbles in mother earth, unburied and unknown.</p><p>Saturday, January 30.—Afternoon, visited Campbell Hospital. Scene of cleaning up the ward and giving the men all clean clothes—through the ward (6), the patients dressing or being dress’d—the naked upper half of the bodies—the good-humor and fun—the shirts, drawers, sheets of beds, &c., and the general fixing up for Sunday. Gave J.L. 50 cents.</p><p>In his observations of nature there is nothing new, but there are a few plain truths (truths which at least since Wordsworth have been the common property of all who ramble in the woods) which are expressed with the freshness of keen observation. Others are most awkward and slovenly efforts to be original:</p><p>'The emotional aspects and influences of Nature!' he exclaims. 'I, too, like the rest, feel these modern tendencies (from all the prevailing intellections, literature and poems) to turn everything to pathos, ennui, morbidity, dissatisfaction, death. Yet how clear it is to me that those are not the born results, influences of Nature at all, but of one's own distorted, sick and silly soul. Here, amid this wild, free scene, how healthy, how joyous, how clean and vigorous and sweet!'</p><p>And then such lapses as these:</p><p>By my great oak—sturdy, vital, green—give feet thick at the butt.</p><p>A grand twelve-acre field of ripe cabbages, with their prevailing hue of malachite green, and floating—flying over and among them in all directions, myriads of these same white butterflies. </p><p>An hour or so after breakfast I wended my way down to the recesses of the aforesaid dell ∗ ∗ ∗ It was just the place and time for my Adamic air-bath and flesh-brushing from head to foot. So hanging clothes on a rail near by, keeping old broad-brim straw on head and easy shoes on feet, haven’t I had a good time the last two hours! First with the stiff-elastic bristles rasping arms, breast, sides, till they turn’d scarlet—then partially bathing in the clear waters of the running brook—taking everything very leisurely, with many rests and pauses—stepping about barefooted every few minutes now and then in some neighboring black ooze, for unctuous mud-bath to my feet— ∗ ∗ ∗ feeling quite secure from obtrusion (and that indeed I am not at all nervous about, if it accidentally happens.) ∗ ∗ ∗ Nature was naked, and I was also. ∗ ∗ ∗ Is nakedness then indecent? No, not inherently.</p><p>Such perverse and eccentric enthusiasm is as poor a substitute for originality as dashes and catalogues of words are for sentences; but among these 'nature-notes' are a few sane, clear and piercing thoughts—glimpses of Jersey in summer without mosquitoes. Whitman boasts of his scientific ignorance of natural history and of botany and refuse to contemplate any object except as a savage, and he thus denies himself the keenest enjoyment of nature as effectively as the mere scientist. The struggle against a theory or habit begets a theory or a habit not less fatal than the one so persistently avoided, and his egotistic disdain of the simplest facts not only makes his own enjoyment less than it would otherwise be, but also makes the most of his notes unintelligible and ridiculous to others. He is an exaggeration of the least happy phase of Thoreau, and his work bears the same relation to the work of his delightful friend, John Burroughs, that the mud in a brick-mill bears to a house.</p><p>'Democratic Vistas,' the long essay in the 'Collect' is a dense cloud, a whirlwind of words and an occasional flash of clear thought. It is what in his own vocabulary might be called an 'oceanic' iteration of the one idea which he has been 'called' to assert:</p><p>Our fundamental want to-day in the United States, with closest, amplest reference to present conditions, and to the future, is of a class, and the clear idea of a class, of native authors, literatures, far different, far higher in grade than any yet known, sacerdotal, modern, fit to cope with our occasions, lands, permeating the whole mass of American mentality, taste, belief, breathing into it a new breath of life, giving it decision, affecting politics far more than the popular superficial suffrage, with results inside and underneath the elections of Presidents or Congresses—radiating, begetting appropriate teachers, schools, manners, and, as its grandest result, accomplishing, (what neither the schools nor the churches and the clergy have hitherto accomplish'd, and without which this nation will no more stand, permanently, soundly, than a house will stand without a substratum,) a religious and moral character beneath the political and productive and intellectual bases of the States. ∗ ∗ ∗ a new Literature, perhaps a new Metaphysics, certainly a new Poetry, are to be, in my opinion, the only sure and worthy supports and expressions of the American Democracy.</p><p>In Whitman's well-known ideas of poetry (intelligently formulated in his criticism but exemplified with disastrous vagueness in his own 'poems') there is one wholesome truth and a deserved rebuke to the poetic fashion of the day. Yet this truth—that culture and art cannot supply the lack of originality and vigor—is as old as criticism; and in his assertion of it he has imitated the owner of a forest who assured a lumberman that his trees were so straight that they leaned the other way. Still the repetition of this single idea, made with a grotesque force and applied to present conditions, is the most important (doubtless the only important) result of his work.</p><p>'The lust and the weird,' he asks, 'that have taken such extraordinary possession of Nineteenth century verse-lovers—what mean they? The inevitable tendency of poetic culture to morbidity, abnormal beauty—the sickliness of all technical thought or refinement in itself—the abnegation of the perennial and democratic concretes at first hand, the body, the earth and the sea, sex and the like—and the substitution of something for them at second or third hand—what bearings have they on current pathological study?</p><p>The curiosities (or, to speak plainly, the barbarities) of Mr. Whitman's vocabulary would be rich matter for Mr. E. A. Freeman to use in his essay on the peculiarities of American speech. A few of the words that he is fond of using are: 'Secesh,' 'hard-pan,' 'grub' (food), 'shebang,' 'broke' (having no money), 'skedaddle,' 'top-loftical,' 'crack' (famous), 'swell' (fashionable), 'boss' (employer), 'literatuses,' 'philosophs.'</p><p>Mr. Whitman is one of the few writers who have anything to say whose volumes the desecrating condenser could improve. A judicious editor could select enough passages from the two bundles of scraps which he calls volumes to make a small book worthy of preservation. But he would have to leave out of it almost everything which it gave the author special pleasure to put into it.</p><p>Walt Whitman's new book, 'Specimen Days and Collect' is a literary curiosity made up of extracts from journals and diaries of different years; disjointed bits of criticism, argument, reminiscence, description and speculation, with comments upon persons, events and things; fragments of essays and correspondence; scraps written for newspapers; samples from his commonplace book, and what is quite as interesting as anything else, a brief biography of himself. Added to this, in a second part of the book, are 'Democratic Vistas,' the long essay written for one of the reviews some years ago; the long preface to the first edition of 'Leaves of Grass,' published in 1855; 'Poetry Today in America,' 'The Poetry of the Future,' and 'A Memorandum of a Venture.' An appendix contains several stories written in the author's youth, and his two first attempts at poetry. There is no trace or suggestion in its pages of what caused his volume of poems to be read out of decent society. The first part of the volume is mostly given up to war reminiscences, and is full of interest. [Published by Rees, Welsh & Co., Philadelphia.</p><p>SPECIMEN DAYS AND COLLECT, by Walt Whitman. Published by Rees, Welsh & Co. Received from David McKay.</p><p>This book is in two parts; the first part is devoted principally to the author's experience in Washington, during the War, visiting the sick and wounded. His kindliness of heart and broad humanity are manifested on every page, and one cannot but regret that he did not have the strength, or the inclination, or both, to make a continuous narration of it, instead of the sketchy little notes with which he has furnished us. Besides these War episodes, he gives us an insight into his love of Nature, and the keen delight he experiences in the open air, in the sun, in the oak, in the full starr'd nights, the common earth—the soil and the skies. Indeed, these short sketches contain material that would make the fortune of a commonwealth of rhyme-makers. He also gives us his impressions of Carlyle and Emerson, of Longfellow, Whittier, and Bryant, impressions evidently softened by age, for his present opinion of Carlyle is not what, we would have looked for in Walt Whitman, and one not at all consistent with the spirit of his 'Democratic Vistas' in the 'Collect.'</p><p>He gives us, likewise, an appreciative critique on Jean Francois Millets's 'Sower,' 'the Diggers,' 'the Angelus' and 'Field-People Reposing.' A view of these pictures certainly has the effect of making the blood boil, and the heart fire-up with much the same sort of flame as burned in the hearts of the Jacquerie. One could have foretold the French Revolution from these pictures, had they been painted in time.</p><p>He also reveals to us his departure from his previous customs, as depicted in the horrible juvenilities in the back of the book. It is a pity the book was disfigured with them. He gives us therein a frightful picture of intemperance, much as a ten-year old Cadet would have done. But on page 188, he owns to draining 'big, brimming, fill'd-up champagne-glasses ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ to the last drop.'</p> <p>The second part, or 'Collect,' is much the more elaborate portion of the work. In 'Democratic Vistas' he gives a thoughtful review of our country, as to its literature, and its political life. Though the acknowledged poet of the 'People of these States,' he does not take a rose-colored view of them, by any means, politically speaking. He says: 'Never was there more hollowness at heart than at present, and here in these United States. ∗ ∗ ∗ The underlying principles of these States are not honestly believed in. We live in an atmosphere of hypocrisy throughout. The men believe not in the women, nor the women in the men. A scornful superciliousness rules in literature. The aim of all the literateurs is something to make fun of. Conversation is a mass of badinage. ∗ ∗ ∗ The depravity of the business classes of our country is not less than has been supposed, but infinitely greater. The official services of America, national, state, and municipal, in all their branches and department, except the judiciary, are saturated in corruption, bribery, falsehood and mal-administration; and the judiciary is tainted. The great cities reek with respectable as much as non-respectable robbery and scoundrelism. In business, (this all-devouring modern word, business) the one sole object is by any means pecuniary gain. The magician's serpent in the fable ate up all the other serpents; and money-making is our magician's serpent, remaining to-day, sole master of the field. The best class we show, is but a mob of fashionably dressed speculators and vulgarians.'</p> <p>Yet of the people he does not despair. Their heroism in the camp, in the battle, and in the hospitals, has convinced him that the material for a great people is at hand. But they must be awakened. Reformers are needed, and though they speak rashly, eagerly, and often inconsiderately, their ill-balanced enthusiasm in the right direction is necessary to disturb the 'inertness and fossilism of human institutions.' This direct exposition of the lamentable defects in our body-politic, is timely, just when the leaven of improvement is beginning to work,—with what result, time only will show. Whether our present system is able to evolve a better state from itself, or whether an entirely new, or at least, a greatly changed form will be necessary to accomplish the desired result, it is now impossible to tell. That our political future is at all doubtful we have no reason to suppose. Though we may go back for a time, though corporations and political bosses may hold our people in bondage for a while, the spirit of civilized communism and socialism is not far enough removed from the minds of our American laboring classes, but a revolution may be inaugurated at any moment. As Walt Whitman says, 'practically, strikes are attempted revolutions, and the Revolutionary War, and the French Revolution were strikes.'</p><p>Walt Whitman attacks, more particulary, our literature, and in fact, all literature. He finds Shakespeare and Scott the poets of the great lords—nowhere are there poets of the people. But it seems to us he fails to recognize at their true value, the poetry of the novelists. He dislikes romances, and does not give them any place. Yet Dickens is as clearly the poet of the people as Walt Whitman, himself. And Victor Hugo, in the French, and Auerbach, in the German. But his greatest grievance is that there is no American literature, as such. But he again is unjust in a measure. Of course, he has no humor, and can recognize no use in it. But Artemus Ward is as redolent of the American soil as Walt Whitman, and while he is not, in any sense, a champion of the people, but rather their satirist. Mark Twain, inferior, it is true, but yet American throughout, is thoroughly republican in thought, tendency and expression. So, also Bret Harte, inefficient and ultra-sentimental, and often weak and incomplete. But granted that we have no distinctive American literature, with the exception of Walt Whitman himself, it was six hundred years after the English nation was formed before Chaucer, the first of English national poets, appeared. And what a long interval elapsed before a great one followed him. And thus, while the nation was untrammeled by traditions and forms. We, who have not assimilated the numerous ingredients furnished us by foreign countries, are not yet even a nation—perhaps, have not even a stable government. We have inherited a rich literature, which we have imbibed in infancy, which is taught in our schools as the model of all that is desirable in thought and style. To strike out a vigorous Republican poem in a country that persecutes the Chinese, that stigmatizes one day the Jews, another the Catholics, and another day some other race or religion, would be almost a sarcasm. It is not a Republic where wealth purchases immunity for crime, where the sheriff furnishes desirable juries, and the prosecuting attorney takes care of the criminal. The administration of justice must be improved, to the end that the voice of the people will be heard—that the government, through its officers, will represent the will of the people. Then, and then only, will we become a nation with national characteristics—and not in the meantime, a colony of Great Britain, speaking the same language, singing the same songs, and generally remaining the unconsidered minor performers in the theatre of English literature.</p><p>But it takes time for all this, and we have reason to be proud that only eighty years after the sounding of the tocsin of American independence, we have already had our Chaucer—Walt Whitman.</p><p><strong>ALL ABOUT WALT WHITMAN.* </strong></p><p>WE have here Mr. Whitman's collected prose. His prose is better than his poetry. It is clean. It is sane. It is intelligible. It is often readable. Much of it is really interesting, because either of its autobiographical effect, its reminiscential quality, or its frank fresh mirroring of out-of-door life and sensation. The book is virile. In many places it has the smell of damp loam or of new-mown grass. It is honest and justifiable. It contains the prose work of its author's life, and shows him at his best all through. Its title, its title-page in the author's rugged autograph, its make-up, and its literary style are all characteristic; and the heliotype portrait, facing p. 122, is strikingly good. The contents are brief essays or sketches, mostly fragmentary, many of them dated as if they were leaves torn from a diary. The first and longest group, occupying 200 pages, is denominated 'Specimen Days.' Following these, under the heads of 'Collect' and 'Notes Left Over' come 150 or more pages of nearly similar material. The volume closes with a hundred pages of 'Pieces in Early Youth,' printed subordinately in fine type. The book is unobjectionable so far as we have noticed, and there is not a little that can be said in its favor.</p><p>Many readers will be interested at once in the opening pages for the details they furnish of Mr. Whitman's ancestry and life. He was born on Long Island, May 31, 1819; and grew up on its shores studying sea-fowl, fishes and fisher-men, wrecks, and nature generally in her wilder moods. As he writes, he tells us, the whole experience comes back to him:</p><p>the soothing rustle of the waves, and the saline smell—boyhood's times, the clam digging, barefoot and with trowsers roll'd up—the hay boat, and the chowder and fishing excursions; or, of later years, little voyages down and out New York bay, in the pilot boats.</p><p>From 1824 to 1828 Mr. Whitman's parents lived in Brooklyn. He remembers Lafayette's visit, and going to hear Elias Hicks preach in a ball-room on the Heights. He began life in earnest as an errand boy in a lawyer's office; subscribed to a circulating library; reveled in the Arabian Nights and Scott's novels and poems; and then went to work to learn the trade of a printer. When he was eighteen he was teaching school in Queens and Suffolk Counties, and 'boarding round.' Then was the time when it was his passion to sail the East River to and fro in the ferry boats, 'often up in the pilot-houses;' where he could 'get a full sweep, absorbing shows, accompaniments, surroundings.' To this succeeded a passion for Broadway and its omnibuses, where he saw Andrew Jackson, Webster, Clay, Seward, Van Buren, Walker the filibuster, Kossuth, Fitz-Greene Halleck, Bryant, the Prince of Wales, Dickens, and a host of other celebrities—among them Cooper and Poe. One of his special reminiscences belonging to this time is this:</p><p>I once saw (it must have been about 1832, of a sharp bright January day) a bent, feeble, but stout-built very old man, bearded, swathed in rich furs, with a great ermine cap on his head, led and assisted, almost carried, down the steps of his high front stoop (a dozen friends and servants, emulous, carefully holding, guiding him) and then lifted and tuck'd in a gorgeous sleigh, envelop'd in other furs, for a ride…I remember the spirited, champing horses, the driver with his whip, and a fellow driver by his side, for extra prudence…It was John Jacob Astor.</p><p>In 1848-9 Mr. Whitman was editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle; then he went South, and worked at journalism a little while in New Orleans; then up into the Northwest and so round to New York again; then took to housebuilding and journalism once more in Brooklyn; and in 1855 began to put his Leaves of Grass to press. He was then in his thirty-sixth year.</p><p>The next sixty pages of the book are devoted to reminiscences of the Civil War, gathered in the Union hospitals among the sick and wounded soldiers. Mr. Whitman did good service as nurse and attendant in those trying days, and relates scores of pathetic incidents of the familiar type in unconventional terms. There is a powerful picture of the effect at Washington of the first Battle of Bull Run. There are graphic descriptions of field and camp hospitals, of trains and boat-loads of wounded, of individual cases of suffering, heroism, and patience, of visits to 'the front,' of death scenes, of Mr. Lincoln as he appeared on horseback with his cavalry escort, and, finally, a few concluding paragraphs under the forcible heading 'The real war will never get into the books.'</p><p>Having finished with the War, Mr. Whitman enters upon a range of bucolic themes, and shows himself to us as a sort of muscular Thoreau, fond of out-of-doors, of farm lanes, brooks and springs, bumble-bees, birds, and so on. He invites us to 'a July afternoon by the pond.' He teaches us 'the lesson of a tree.' He gives us a handful of 'autumn side-bits.' He spends 'a winter day on the beach.' He wanders out in the 'full-starr'd nights.' He takes a sun-bath, in sheer nakedness, in a secluded dell, once a marl-pit, 'now abandon'd, fill'd with bushes, trees, grass, a group of willows, a straggling bank, and a spring of delicious water running right through the middle of it, with two or three little cascades.' Look at this sturdy child of Nature playing with his mother:</p><p>Hanging clothes on a rail near by, keeping old broadbrim straw on head, and easy shoes on feet, haven't I had a good time the last two hours! First with the stiff-elastic bristles rasping arms, breast, sides, till they turn'd scarlet—then partially bathing in the clear waters of the running brook—taking everything very leisurely, with many rests and pauses—stepping about barefooted every few minutes now and then in some neighboring black ooze, for unctuous mud- baths to my feet—a brief second and third rinsing in the crystal running waters—rubbing with the fragrant towel—slow negligent promenades on the turf up and down in the sun, varied with occasional rests…Somehow I seem'd to get identity with each and every thing around me, in its condition. Nature was naked, and I was also.</p><p>Mingled with rambles and rambling meditations such as these are fragments of wider observations—days on the Delaware, views and experiences in the South and the far West, notes on his visit to Boston a year or two since, and, among distinctively literary topics, paragraphs—they are hardly more than that—on Bryant, Emerson, Carlyle, and Longfellow. These finish the 'Specimen Days.'</p><p>The 'Collect' which follows opens with a long political and sociologic essay on 'Democratic Vistas.' The several prefaces to Leaves of Grass, 1855, 1872, 1876, succeed; then the North American Review paper on 'Poetry Today in America;' and finally a defense of Leaves of Grass from the charge of indecency, and a 'lecture' on the death of Lincoln.</p><p>As to Mr. Whitman's prose it is obviously quite interchangeable with his poetry. Many pages of this book might be transferred to Leaves of Grass by simply a rearrangement of lines. Thus (p. 109):</p><p>Cold and sharp last night—<br>Clear and not much wind—<br>The full moon shining, and a fine spread of constellations<br>and little and big stars—<br>Sirius very bright, rising early,<br>Preceded by many-orb'd Orion, glittering, vast, sworded, <br>and chasing with his dog.</p><p>Or again (p. 132):</p><p>It was a happy thought to build the Hudson river railroad<br>right along the shore.<br>The grade is already made by nature;<br>You are sure of ventilation one side—<br>And you are in nobody's way.<br>I see, hear, the locomotives and cars,<br>Rumbling, roaring, flaming, smoking,<br>Constantly, away off there, night and day—<br>Less than a mile distant, and in full view by day.<br>I like both sight and sound.<br>Express trains thunder and lighten along;<br>Of freight trains, most of them very long,<br>There cannot be less than a hundred a day.</p><p>If this is not excellent poetry, measured by the Whitman standard, we are greatly mistaken. But, seriously, in his prose Mr. Whitman shows us a pleasanter side of himself than we have hitherto known.</p><p>∗Specimen Days and Collect. By Walt Whitman. Philadelphia: Rees Welsh & Co. $2.00.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S PROSE.</strong></p><p>Walt Whitman's 'Specimen Days and Collect' is not, as its name might be supposed to imply, a book of religious exercises. It is a miscellaneous gathering of his prose writings, early attempts, bits of letters, extracts from note-books and diaries, and what not,—a pretty miscellaneous collection, without much connection except the author's personality, which looms up immensely through it, as it does through everything else he has written. The stories written while he was still in his teens are so melodramatic and unreal, that they would be unworthy of notice were it not for the premonitions they give of the author's powers. They have an intensity that almost reaches imagination, and they show also marked tendency to dwell upon the horrible. Out of nine tales seven are death-scenes, most of them with horrid accessories of cruelty and hate and lust. The melodramatic element in them belonged to his youth, and was entirely outgrown as his strength developed, but the brutal side of life has always retained a painful fascination for him. In the later writings in this volume he appears to much better advantage, notwithstanding their heterogeneousness. The passages about the civil war (he was in the hospitals through the greater part of the war) are very vivid, horribly so at times, with a fiery light like Carlyle's. The description of the death of Lincoln might have been a study for the 'French Revolution.' There is a milder description of Washington after the great defeat at Bull Run. </p> <p> He had naturally a warm appreciation of Carlyle, and writes well of him. Emerson is too good and too beautiful, with too little of the wild bull to satisfy him. Occasionally he is extremely unfortunate in his comments, as when he says that it is as a critic and not as a poet or artist or teacher that Emerson excels—than which nothing could well be more erroneous. He had a keen appreciation of Carlyle's worship of force, and possessed his power of vivifying details, and even something of his style. He has a freshness and manly vigor that the dyspeptic Scotchman did not share. But he has shown none of the capacity for concentrated and prolonged effort that is essential for great work, and none of the aspiration for, or even conception of the ideal, which raises a work into art and made Carlyle a leader among men. In this volume Mr. Whitman adheres to his old theories, but his taste has grown purer, and there is comparatively little to offend. </p> <p><strong>Walt Whitman's Prose.</strong></p><p>The author of 'Leaves of Grass' has published a volume made up of odds and ends in prose and entitled 'Specimen Days.' It is a heterogeneous collection of autobiographical notes, extracts from diaries, early writings, and recent contributions to periodicals. It contains a good deal that is interesting, with a good deal that need not have been revived. Mr. Whitman himself does not seem to be quite sure why he has pursued so comprehensive a scheme of preservation. The explanation could perhaps be found in a certain naïve vanity which extends its protection to every scrap of paper bearing the memorandum of an idea or the record of a fact. </p><p>We are obliged to confess that Walt Whitman's prose is best when it is least characteristic. When he writes simply, forgetting himself and his responsibilities as the apostle of a new school, he is often very interesting, as notably in his accounts of hospital experience during the war. But he generally remembers himself pretty soon, and with the return to self-consciousness comes a certain straining after effect that is not always pleasant. Many passages have little but continuous typographical arrangement to distinguish them from his poetry. Here, for example, is a paragraph which we have divided into verses with other alteration. He has been describing a scene of massacre: </p><p>Multiply the above by scores, aye hundreds;<br>Verify it in all the forms that different circumstances,<br>individuals, places, could afford;<br>Light it with every lurid passion, the wolf's, the lion's<br>lapping thirst for blood,<br>The passionate, boiling volcanoes of human revenge<br>for comrades, brothers slain;<br>With the light of burning farms, and heaps of smutting,<br>smouldering black embers,<br>And in the human heart everywhere black, worse<br>embers—<br>And you have an inkling of this war.</p><p>Mr. Whitman rescues from oblivion the names of some of the chieftains who flourished in the Homeric age of Broadway stage driving. In the days when the Red Birds and Yellow Birds, the Knickerbocker and Fourth avenue and the old Broadway lines were still crowding the thoroughfare now occupied by the Fifth and Madison avenue and Twenty-third street stages only, he used to study and admire the wonderful qualities of Broadway Jack, Dressmaker, Balky Bill, George Storms, Old Elephant (and afterward his brother, Young Elephant), Tippy, Pop Rice, Big Frank, Yellow Joe, Pete Callahan, Patsy Dee, and others of equal professional rank. He used to ride on top of the stages day and night beside these quick-eyed heroes, and astonish them by declaiming passages from Shakespeare above the rest of Broadway. 'I suppose the critics will laugh heartily,' he says, with unconscious humor, 'but the influence of those Broadway omnibus jaunts and drivers and declamations and escapades undoubtedly entered into the gestation of 'Leaves of Grass.'</p><p>Specimen Days and Collect By Walt Whitman. (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh & Co.)</p><p>'ECHOES AND ESCAPADES,' 'Drifts and Cumulus,' 'Notes of a Half-Paralytic'—these and other titles for his bundle of jottings, made during and after the war, were rejected by Whitman; and for a while he hovered about a title which would have suggested a comparison between this cluster of open-air thoughts and observations and the berries of the wild cedar-tree of America.</p> <p>'A melange of loafing, looking, hobbling, sitting, traveling—a little thinking thrown in for salt, but very little—not only summer but all seasons—not only days but nights—some literary meditations—books, authors examined, Carlyle, Poe, Emerson tried (always under my cedar-tree, in the open air, and never in the library)—mostly the scenes everybody sees, but some of my own caprices, meditations, egotism—truly an open air and mainly summer formation—singly or in clusters—wild and free and somewhat acrid.'</p> <p>The acrid taste is no more than a pleasant sharpness now and again; and in the main these 'Notes of a Half-Paralytic' are sweet and sane and nourishing, more, perhaps, than their writer knows or can know. No diary of an invalid is wholesomer reading than this; never a groan or a growl, never a word of complaint; but every bright hour, every breeze of health, every delight in flower and bird and stream and star, and in the kind voice or hand of a friend, remembered and recorded. Always, in this invalid's diary, the pure, fresh air, and the sky overhead; never the blinds drawn down, the table crowded with medicine bottles, and the foot of the spiritual medicine-man upon the threshold:</p> <p>'Doubtless in the course of the following, the fact of invalidism will crop out (I call myself a half-Paralytic these days, and reverently bless the Lord it is no worse) between some of the lines—but I get my share of fun and healthy hours, and shall try to indicate them. (The trick is, I find, to tone your wants and tastes low down enough, and make much of negatives, and of mere daylight and the skies.)'</p> <p>From 1876, when Whitman began to get over the worst of the tedious and baffling illness, ascribed by physicians to his exertions in the hospitals during the war, he spent portions of several seasons at a secluded haunt in New Jersey—Timber Creek, its stream (almost a river) entering from the great Delaware twelve miles away, 'with primitive solitudes, recluse and woody banks, sweet-feeding springs, and all the charms that birds, grass, wild-flowers, rabbits and squirrels, old oaks, walnut-trees, &c., can bring.' Down the long farm-lane he would hobble to a lonely pond, where the creek expands and the kingfishers dart and turn; and so, still sauntering on, 'to the spring under the willows—musical as soft-clinking glasses—pouring a sizeable stream, thick as my neck, pure and clear, out from its vent, where the bank arches over.' And here, enveloped for the month of May in the droning of bumble-bees, listening to the clear quailnotes in June, or the roulades and pensive refrains of the hermit-thrush, Whitman would take his seat on log or stump, and (the journalist's ruling passion strong in age and disablement) would jot down his notes—notes not for the buoyant and healthy alone, but meant just as well for ailing folk:—</p> <p>'Who knows (I have it in my fancy, my ambition) but the pages now ensuing may carry ray of sun, or smell of grass or corn, or call of bird, or gleam of stars by night, or snowflakes falling fresh and mystic, to denizen of heated city-house, or tired workman or workwoman?—or may-be in sick room or prison—to serve as cooling breeze, or Nature's aroma, to some fever'd mouth or latent pulse.'</p> <p>Sometimes he would run down by rail to the New Jersey sea-shore; and on those flat and odorous sea-prairies, their sedgy perfume in his nostrils, he would revive the sights and sounds and smells of his Long Island youth, the 'stretch of interminable white-brown sand, hard and smooth and broad, with the ocean perpetually, grandly rolling in upon it, with slow-measured sweep, with rustle and hiss and foam, and many a thump as of low bass drums.' Or, back again in his Camden home, he would cross and recross the Delaware, helped by the friendly pilots ('Eugene Crosby, with his strong, young arm so often supporting, circling, convoying me over the gaps of the bridge, through impediments, safely aboard'), and would enjoy the stir and play of the delightful 'human comedy,' or would invite his soul, and absorb the spectacle of the starry heavens.</p>  <p>'A January Night.—Fine trips across the wide Delaware to-night. Tide pretty high, and a strong ebb. River, a little after eight, full of ice, mostly broken, but some large cakes making our strong-timber'd steamboat hum and quiver as she strikes them. In the clear moonlight they spread, strange, unearthly, silvery, faintly glistening, as far as I can see. Bumping, trembling, sometimes hissing like a thousand snakes, the tide-procession, as we wend with or through it, affording a grand undertone, in keeping with the scene. Overhead, the splendor indescribable; yet something haughty, almost supercilious, in the night. Never did I realise more latent sentiment, almost passion, in those silent interminable stars up there. One can understand, such a night, why, from the days of the Pharaohs or Job, the dome of heaven, sprinkled with planets, has supplied the subtlest, deepest criticism on human pride, glory, ambition.'</p> <p>We have record of visits to New York, and a sail in the bay, with a little lyrical cry at sight of the schooner-yachts going in a good wind—'those daring, careening things of grace and wonder, those white and shaded swift-darting fish-birds (I wonder if sea or shore elsewhere can outvie them), ever with their slanting spars, and fierce, pure, hawk-like beauty and motion.' But the procession of gentility and wealth in Central Park is not altogether to Whitman's liking; and in his criticism of modern society, although at bottom he believes that the American people remains sound, there are pages (to quote Mr. Ruskin's words with respect to Whitman's writings) 'deadly true—in the sense of rifles—against our deadliest sins.' More than once Whitman voyaged up the Hudson to the honeysuckle-and-rose-embowered cottage of John Burroughs, the delightful writer of Wake Robin and Pepacton; and in September 1879 he found himself strong enough to begin a long jaunt to the West, seeing Missouri, Kansas, and Colorado, at Denver turning south, and then east again. The sea-like spread of prairies, the wild gorges, the streams of amber and bronze, brawling along their beds with frequent cascades and snow-white foam, the fantastic forms of mountains bathed in transparent browns, faint reds and grays, the free handling and absolute uncrampedness of the landscape, the superb physique of the miners, their character shaped by their victorious tussles with savage nature (but alas, the genteel ladies of the West, copying unsuccessfully their Eastern sisters!)—these, with a few inevitable reserves, were all acceptable to, and accepted by, the author of Leaves of Grass. A later journey to Canada, the sight of Niagara, a visit to the hospitable house of his friend Dr. Bucke at London, then up the black waters of the Saguenay a hundred miles, the region more grim, more wildly beautiful, 'with a sort of still and pagan scaredness,' than any he had seen yet, comprised the last of Whitman's wanderings. A Sunday service with the insane at the asylum under the care of Dr. Bucke brought Whitman face to face with some of those 'laggards' in the race who have ever been dear to his heart:</p> <p>'I was furnish'd with an arm-chair near the pulpit, and sat facing the motley, yet perfectly well-behaved and orderly, congregation. The quaint dresses and bonnets of some of the women, several very old and gray, here and there like the heads in old pictures. O the looks that came from those faces! There were two or three I shall probably never forget. Nothing at all markedly repulsive or hideous—strange enough I did not see one such. Our common humanity, mine and yours, everywhere—</p> <p>'The same old blood—the same red, running blood;' yet behind most, an inferr'd arriere of such storms, such wrecks, such mysteries, fires, love, wrong, greed for wealth, religious problems, crosses—mirror'd from those crazed faces (yet now temporarily so calm, like still waters), all the woes and sad happenings of life and death—now from everyone the devotional element radiating—was it not, indeed, the peace of God that passeth all understanding, strange as it may sound?'</p> <p>Connected with the notes of convalescence in this volume are Whitman's previously published memoranda of the war; and the national frenzy and agony (with underlying sanity and strength) of the one period goes well with the tender calm and restorative happiness of the other. His lecture on Lincoln, a record of his visits to Emerson and Longfellow, a reminiscence and a criticism, severe, yet sympathetic, of Edgar Poe, will interest readers who care to see great or distinguished persons through a poet's eyes. At Emerson's grave he muses:</p><p>'A just man, poised on himself, all-loving, all-inclosing, and sane and clear as the sun. Nor does it seem so much Emerson himself we are here to honor—it is conscience, simplicity, culture, humanity's attributes at their best, yet applicable, if need be, to average affairs…How shall I henceforth dwell on the blessed hours when, not long since, I saw that benignant face, the clear eyes, the silently smiling mouth, the form yet upright in its great age—to the very last, with so much spring and cheeriness, and such an absence of decrepitude, that even the term venerable hardly seemed fitting?'</p> <p>The tribute is made of more worth by Whitman's keen perception of the limita- tions of Emerson's genius. Elsewhere there is eloquent recognition of the work done for American literature by Longfellow, Bryant, Whittier. I miss from this collection of notes an admirable piece of criticism on Burns, published in Our Land and Time (January 25, 1875). In Edgar Poe, Whitman finds neither the genius for perfect and noble living and thinking, morally without flaw, happily balanced in activity, nor 'that other shape of personality dearer far to the artist-sense (which likes the strongest play of lights and shades) where the perfect character, the good, the heroic, although never attain'd, it never lost sight of, but through failures, sorrows, temporary downfalls, is return'd to again and again' (so with Burns, Byron, George Sand):</p> <p>'Almost without the first sign of moral principle, or of the concrete and its heroisms, or the simpler affections of the heart, Poe's verses illustrate an intense faculty for technical and abstract beauty, with the rhyming art to ex- cess, an incorrigible propensity towards nocturnal themes, a demoniac undertone behind every page—and, by final judgment, belong among the electric lights of imaginative literature, brilliant and dazzling, but with no heat…In a dream I once had, I saw a vessel on the sea, at midnight, in a storm. It was no great full-rigg'd ship, nor majestic steamer, steering firmly through the gale, but seem'd one of those superb little schooner-yachts I had so often seen lying anchor'd, rocking so jauntily in the waters around New York, or up Long Island Sound—now flying uncontroll'd with torn sails and broken spars through the wild sleet, and winds and waves of the night. On the deck was a slender, slight, beautiful figure, a dim man, apparently enjoying all the terror, the murk, and the dislocation of which he was the centre and the victim. That figure of my lurid dream might stand for Edgar Poe, his spirit, his fortunes, and his poems -themselves all lurid dreams.'</p> <p>Beside 'Democratic Vistas,' known to all who value Whitman, this volume contains the recent articles by him in the North American Review ('Poetry to-day in America' and 'A Memorandum at a Venture'), the prefaces to the several editions of his poems, and some pieces written in early youth—short tales and poems—printed now to avoid the annoyance of a surreptitious issue which had been announced.</p> <p>Among other restoratives of health one could wish that Whitman would some time try a voyage across the Atlantic. With Mr. Tennyson, Mr. Ruskin, Mr. Rossetti, Mr. Symonds, Mr. Swinburne, Mr. W. Bell Scott, Mr. R. Hengist Horne, Mr. Robert Buchanan, Mr. Robert L. Stevenson, the Hon.

By WALT WHITMAN. Philadelphia: Rees, Walsh, & Co. $2.</p> <p>IN our issue for March 21st 1882, we drew attention to the then recently published English edition of Walt Whitman's volume of Poems, 'Leaves of Grass.' The writer of that notice felt bound to hail Whitman as the poet who beyond all others was imbued with, and gave expression to, the Modern Spirit. The chants in the 'Leaves of Grass' convey, in a form as beautiful as it is original, the universal wonder and sympathy which fill the mind of a poet who cares not so much to speculate upon the mysterious future as 'to loafe' and enjoy the more mysterious present. The problems of existence have a subordinate place in his regard: the fact of existence is the consummate object of his thoughts. Remarkable as are his poems for their originality, their strength, and their beauty, the volume of prose now before us exceeds them in each of these attributes. Not to many poets is given to be great prose writers. Probably Victor Hugo alone of all the writers in this century has achieved supreme excellence in both. We may incur the charge of exaggeration, especially from those whose sympathies in this matter we are not entitled to expect; but we are inclined to trust posterity to endorse the verdict, that Walt Whitman is one of the very greatest writers in prose and poetry which the nineteenth century has produced. The theory that genius is still inspired has new confirmation in his works. Isaiah and Jeremiah, in the 'broadsheets' in which they rebuked their Jewish fellow- countrymen for the hollowness of their worship and for their social sins, were not more trenchant than this modern prophet, who denounces the shams of an age more civilized but probably more corrupt than theirs. 'Is there,' says Whitman, 'a great moral and religious civilization—the only justification of a great material one? Confess that to severe eyes, using the moral microscope upon humanity, a sort of dry and flat Sahara appears, these cities, crowded with petty grotesques, malformations, phantoms, playing meaningless antics. Confess that everywhere, in shop, street, church, theatre, bar-room, official chair, are pervading flippancy and vulgarity, low cunning, infidelity.'</p> <p>The first writings of Carlyle and Emerson were despised and rejected; and yet these very writings have had so profound an influence in forming the thought of our period, that it were impossible to imagine, as Whitman remarks, what it would have been without them. The mantle of Carlyle has in a sense fallen upon Whitman. Without Carlyle's historic sense, without his bitter personal irony, he has all Carlyle's contempt for humbug, all his withering scorn of the respectabilities, all his earnestness and enthusiasm for the true democracy. Less a man of books, more a man of men,—less a recluse, more a man of the world,—than either Carlyle or Emerson, he adds new point to their texts, and finds new sermons in them. Learned, Whitman certainly is—a man of vast reading, fulfilled more than most students with what is to be had from books. He is more. His immense pliability of intellect, his subtle power of fixing his gaze with intimate scrutiny, enable him to absorb suggestions from everything. He reads a man—the very spinal marrow of him—not as an anatomist or a psychologist, or a man of business or a tailor, but as they all would do. The separate, special individuality: that seizes Whitman's attention—and he has the man. Thus, he examines the individual, and through him the aggregate. Society, its foibles, its rottenness, is transparent to him, and he does not spare it. While he is one of the most powerful advocates of the rights of the democracy, he never ceases to urge the necessity of its making private and public virtue as much an aim as political power. With the grasp of a true seer, he never sighs for 'the old days that are ended,' but attempts to urge on a future richer than any past in strong men and women, 'in crops of fine youths and majestic old persons.' The means he purposes using, and advocating the use of, are not legislative—they are intellectual. 'Of all this, and these lamentable conditions,' he says, in continuation of [the] passage quoted above, 'to breathe into them the breath recuperative of sane and heroic life, I say a new-founded literature, not merely to copy and reflect existing surfaces, or to pander to what is called good taste, not only to amuse, pass away time, celebrate the beautiful, the refined, the past, or exhibit technical, rhythmic, or grammatical dexterity, but a literature underlying life, religious, consistent with science, handling the elements and forces with competent power, teaching and training men—and, perhaps the most precious of its results—achieving the entire redemption of women out of these incredible holds and webs of silliness, millinery and every kind of dyspeptic depletion, and thus ensuring to the States a strong and sweet Female Race—a race of Perfect Mothers—is what is needed.'</p> <p>In 'Democratic Vistas' he expounds his political philosophy more consecutively and eloquently than anywhere else:—</p> <p>'The political history of the past may be summed up as having grown out of what underlies the words, order, safety, caste, and especially out of the need of some prompt deciding authority, and of cohesion at all cost. Leaping time, we come to the period within the memory of people now living, when, as from some lair where they had slumbered long, accumulating wrath, sprang up and are yet active (1790, and on even to the present, 1870), those noisy eructations, destructive iconoclasms, a fierce sense of wrongs, amid which moves the power [sic], well known in modern history, in the Old World, stain'd with much blood, and marked by savage reactionary clamors and demands. These bear mostly as on one inclosing point of need. For after the rest is said—after the many time-honor'd and really true things for subordination, experience, right of property, &c., have been listen'd to and acquiesced in—after the valuable and well-settled statement of our duties and relations in society is thoroughly conn'd over and exhausted—it remains to bring forward and modify everything else with the idea of that Something a Man is, (last precious consolation of the drudging poor,) standing apart from all else, divine in his own right, and a woman in hers, sole and untouchable by any canons of authority, or any rule derived from precedent, state-safety, the acts of legislatures, or even from what is called religion, modesty, or art. The radiation of this truth is the key of the most significant doings of our immediately preceding three centuries, and has been the political genesis and life of America. Advancing visibly, it still more advances invisibly. Underneath the fluctuations of the expressions of society, as well as the movements of the politics of the leading nations of the world, we see steadily pressing ahead and strengthening itself, even in the midst of immense tendencies toward aggregation, this image of completeness in separatism, of individual personal dignity, of a single person, either male or female, characterized in the main, not from extrinsic acquirements or position, but in the pride of himself or herself alone; and, as an eventual conclusion and summing up (or else the entire scheme of things is aimless, a cheat, a crash), the simple idea that the last, best dependence is to be upon humanity itself, and its own inherent, normal, full-grown qualities, without any superstitious support whatever.'</p> <p>'The purpose of democracy—supplanting old belief in the necessary absoluteness of establish'd dynastic ruleship, temporal, ecclesiastical, and scholastic, as furnishing the only security against chaos, crime, and ignorance—is, through many transmigrations, and amid endless ridicules, arguments, and ostensible failures, to illustrate, at all hazards, this doctrine or theory that man, properly trained in sanest, highest freedom, may and must become a law, and series of laws, unto himself, surrounding and providing for, not only his own personal control, but all his relations to other individuals, and to the state; and that, while other theories, as in the past histories of nations have proved wise enough, and indispensable perhaps for their conditions, this, as matters now stand in our civilized world, is the only scheme worth working from, as warranting results like those of Nature's laws, reliable, when once establish'd, to carry on themselves.'</p> <p>'Literature, strictly considered, has never recognized the People, and whatever may be said does not to-day. Speaking generally, the tendencies of literature, as hitherto pursued, have been to make mostly critical and querulous men. It seems as if, so far, there were some natural repugnance between a literary and professional life, and the rude rank spirit of democracies. There is in later literature, a treatment of benevolence, a charity business, rife enough it is true; but I know nothing more rare, even in this country, than a fit scientific estimate and reverent appreciation of the People—of their measureless wealth of latent power and capacity, their vast, artistic contrasts of lights and shades—with, in America, their entire reliability in emergencies, and a certain breadth of historic grandeur, of peace or war, far surpassing all the vaunted samples of book-heroes, or any haut ton coteries, in all the records of the world.'</p> <p>'To formulate beyond this present vagueness—to help, live, and put before us the species, or specimen of the species of the democratic ethnology of the future, is a work toward which the genius of our land, with peculiar encouragement, invites her well-wishers. Already certain limnings, more or less grotesque, more or less fading and watery, have appeared. We, too (repressing doubts and qualms), will try our hand. Attempting then, however crudely, a basic model or portrait of personality for general use for the manliness of the States—and doubtless that is most useful which is most simple and comprehensive for all, and toned low enough—we should prepare the canvas well beforehand. Parentage must consider itself in advance…To our model a clear-blooded, strong-fibered physique is indispensable; the questions of food, drink, air, exercise, assimilation, digestion, can never be intermitted. Out of these we decry a well-begotten self-hood—in youth fresh, ardent, emotional, aspiring, full of adventure; at maturity brave, perceptive, under control, neither too talkative nor too reticent, neither flippant nor somber; of the bodily figure the movements easy, the complexion showing the best blood, somewhat flushed, breast expanded, an erect attitude, a voice whose sound outvies music, eyes of calm and steady gaze, yet capable of flashing, and a general presence that holds its own in the company of the highest, for it is native personality, and that alone, that endows a man to stand before presidents or generals, or in any distinguished collection with aplomb, and not culture or any knowledge or intellect whatever.'</p> <p>A large part of the volume is occupied by Whitman's diary during the American War. Some of the sketches were written as letters to friends during the war and afterwards. All of them have the same nervous strength. They are, indeed, as he says, 'a batch of convulsively written reminiscences.' Why should they not? 'They are but parts of the actual distraction, heat, smoke, and excitement of those times. The war itself, with the temper of society preceding it, can indeed be best described by that very word convulsiveness.' We can only give two of these sketches:—</p><p><strong>'THREE YEARS SUMM'D UP.</strong></p><p>'During those three years in hospital, camp, or field, I made over six hundred visits or tours, and went, as I estimate, counting all, among from eighty thousand to a hundred thousand of the wounded and sick, as sustainer of spirit and body in some degree, in time of need. These visits varied from an hour or two, to all day or night; for with dear or critical cases I generally watch'd all night. Sometimes I took up my quarters in the hospital, and slept or watch'd there several nights in succession. Those three years I consider the greatest privilege and satisfaction, (with all their feverish excitements and physical deprivations and lamentable sights,) and, of course, the most profound lesson of my life.'</p><p><strong>'THE MILLION DEAD, TOO, SUMM'D UP.</strong></p><p>'The dead in this war, there they lie, strewing the fields, and woods, and valleys, and battlefields of the South—Virginia, the Peninsula, Malvern Hill and Fair Oaks, the banks of the Chickahominy, the terraces of Fredericks- burgh, Antietam Bridge, the grisly ravines of Manassas, the bloody pro- menade of the Wilderness; the varieties of the strayed dead; Gettysburgh, the West, Southwest; Vicksburgh, Chattanooga, the trenches of Petersburgh; the numberless battles, camps, hospitals everywhere; the crop reap'd by the mighty reapers, and typhoid, dysentery, inflammations, and blackest and loathsomest of all, the dead and living burial-pits, the prison- pens of Andersonville, Salisbury, Belle-Isle, &c. (not Dante's pictured hell, and all its woes, its degradations, filthy torments, excell'd those prisons.) The dead, the dead, the dead,—our dead—on South or North, ours all (all, all, all, finally dear to me), or East or West—Atlantic Coast or Mississippi Valley—somewhere they crawl'd to die, alone, in bushes, low gullies, or on the sides of the hills— . . .thousands, aye tens of thousands, of Southerners crumble to-day in Northern earth.'</p><p>'Mr. Whitman's 'Specimen Days and Collect' is a book to be picked up at an odd moment and read in instalments, like the letters of a friend. It is as full of individuality as an egg is of albumen. It gives one insight into the mind of the poet. The 'Specimen Days' are of course extracts from diary memoranda. They are as odd as a Chinese picture; different from anything else in the literary line ever published. It is curious to wander back through the years with the 'Good Grey Poet' and read his thoughts, see with his eyes and be affected through his nerves and sensibilities. It is no small privilege. They are gathered together at hap-hazard, and that only adds to their nameless charm; nameless because so unexpected and that nothing quite meets their nomenclature.</p> <p>The latter half of the volume is an olla podrida of notes, essays, lectures and memoranda with one or two poems. Here at last is a book by Walt Whitman, in whose pages no mawkish morality and squinting prudery can find a line to erase or change. It is as pure as the mountain wind and as free. It is not an easy book to characterize, but it is a book which every lover of our literature will prize not only as a curiosity but as full of things worth remembering.'</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S PROSE.</strong></p><p>Specimen Days and Collect By WALT WHITMAN. Philadelphia: Rees, Welsh & Co.</p> <p>The whole of Walt Whitman's prose writing is included in this closely printed book. So much has been said upon Whitman's place in literature, judgment upon his worth is so various and confused—Prof. Dowden, for instance, associates him with Shakespeare, and a recent commentator of American literature whistles him confidently down the wind to nothingness—that his own expression and elucidation of himself must be regarded with peculiar interest by large numbers of readers. The new book is certainly not wanting in versatility. It contains many of those brief, sketchily written notes on nature which were, it is apparent, jotted down in the open air, amid the freshness of fields and woods and streams; it contains the celebrated 'Democratic Vistas,' which tell of the politics, progress, and nationality of our Western world; and it includes, above all, those widely discussed prefaces, touching upon American poetry to-day, and especially upon the future of American poetry, as this is viewed by Whitman. At the end of the book there is a series of 'notes left over,' and there are reprinted some of the author's early work in prose and verse. Persons who are inspired by the cosmic exultation in Leaves of Grass should not fail to compare those radical poems with the poet's manner and thought in the verses called 'Dough-Face Song,' and in a highly moral tale like 'Death in a Schoolroom.' These early pieces are, it must be seen, not worth reprinting; and Whitman has set them, it is clear, in a somewhat frank spirit of defiance. It has often been stated by his critics that his youthful work was essentially mediocre and imitative, and that he changed his manner in order that he might be accounted an original poet; but Whitman takes the tenable ground, evidently, that he has outgrown his first work and has moved forward progressively. He believes that he can afford to compare Leaves of Grass and Specimen Days with the labor of his green literary years.</p> <p>As to Whitman's prose manner—the manner which may be described as his style—that is found to be, throughout this book, a kind of cultivated affectation, not at all forcible because it is unconventional. It is an obscure, involved, harsh manner, frequently ungrammatical and cumbersome: seldom graceful, direct, or simple. It is best when it is most free from the writer's word-torturings. Occasionally Whitman throws off his affectations and composes with straightforward lucidity; the fact that he can do this and does it proves conclusively that he depends for one sort of effect upon literary eccentricity and trickery. It is probable, however, that he has faith to some degree in his own tricks. On the other hand, it may be said of him that he can rise to the dignity of a large subject, as in the preface to the first edition of Leaves of Grass. He has, moreover, a certain mastery of picturesque word- painting, which finds an abundant, vigorous outlet in his works on nature. His prose, taken altogether, is not especially distinguishable from his verse—if, indeed, he can be said to have written verse. The constant use which he makes of the hyphen amounts to his fashion of breaking phrases and sentences in 'Leaves of Grass.'</p> <p>The picturesqueness and the imaginative feeling, also the spirit of broad human tenderness, which are felt in the notes will, one is apt to think, win the attention of many readers who cannot find their way through the extravagance and garrulity of Whitman's verse; in spite of the fact, too, that his verse has, in a crude state, sound poetic qualities and robustly original conceptions. It is far less what Whitman writes that stirs many observant men than what he sees or suggests. His conceptions of mankind, of present nationality, of the real earth and the world, are vital to the imagination. He is not, it is discovered by thinkers who are abreast of the science of our time, a sentimental idealist. He does not regard longingly the world as it was or as it might be. He is not blind to the thousand and one facts of life to which, seemingly, poets are densely blind. He views broadly, radically, the evolution of man, of nature, and of society. It is his stand-point which is his strong point. His force, his purpose, is new in literature. A poet who searches so deep and high could hardly fail to gain his adherents. It is because Whitman is so little of an artist, because he is a rhapsodist rather than a poet, that he misses his mark with the bulk of readers. Nevertheless, he is more tempered in his prose. The condensation of prose appears to hold him in check. His notes might be read with delight—by one grown accustomed to his spasmodic style—under the open sky. Many of his descriptions charm the fancy. He speaks of 'the beautiful, spiritual insects;' of the 'rising and falling wind-purr from the tops of the maples and willows;' of 'the indolent and spiritual night, inexpressibly rich, tender, suggestive;' of 'the monotone and liquid gurgle from the hoarse, sumptuous, copious fall;' of 'the flap of a pike leaping out and rippling the water;' of 'the guttural twittering' of the kingfishers; of bumble-bees 'humming their perpetual rich mellow boom;' and one might quote a long list of still happier phrases. The following note, placed at the end of some war reminiscences, is quite characteristic of Whitman, and exhibits his tendency to dwell on words, no matter how awkwardly he may employ his language: 'As I have looked over the proof-sheets of the preceding pages, I have once or twice feared that my diary would prove at best but a batch of convulsively written reminiscences. Well, be it so. They are but parts of the actual distraction, heat, smoke, and excitement of those times. The war itself, with the temper of society preceding it, can indeed be best described by that very word convulsiveness.' It should be mentioned that Whitman's reminiscences of the civil war are honest, pathetic comments upon serious, at times tragic, episodes. Whitman knows what the war days were; he has felt their horror and mournfulness; and he writes about them with a sincere candor which cannot be confounded with his usual strain for effect. In his prose notes, as in his patriotic chants, his voice is sure and tender. Some of the most imaginative and also realistic of his notes are inspired by night, with all its stars and infinite distances, with its strange and solemn silence, with its universal beauty. He describes, for example, the emotion which is aroused in him by a Winter night: 'I don't know anything more thrilling than to be on the wide firm deck of a powerful boat, a clear, cool, extra moonlight night, crushing proudly and resistlessly through this thick, marbly, glistening ice. The whole river is now spread with it—some immense cakes. There is such weirdness about the scene - partly the quality of the light, with its tinge of blue, the lunar twilight—only the large stars holding their own in the radiance of the moon. Temperature sharp, comfortable for motion, dry, full of oxygen. But the sense of power—the steady, scornful, imperious urge of our strong new engine, as she plows her way through the big and little cakes.' In this brief paragraph there may be found that stalwartism of sense and soul which is so enthusiastically admired by the Whitman men, and which is, without doubt, an impressive trait in the poet.</p> <p>Whitman's notes are not confined to war, reminiscences and descriptions; he gives in a few of them his opinions of certain men and his views upon various subjects. He writes upon the death of Carlyle, upon Carlyle from an American point of view, upon his visit to Boston, upon four American poets—Bryant, Longfellow, Whittier, and Emerson. He rebukes a magazine critic who attacked him for his 'attitude of contempt and scorn and intolerance' toward our leading poets. He says: 'I can't imagine any better luck befalling these States for a poetical beginning and initiation than has come from Emerson, Longfellow, Bryant, and Whittier.' Emerson, he thinks, stands at the head of the four. He is at a loss to give precedence to either of the others. His description of them is flattering, not to put too fine a point upon it: 'Each illustrious, each rounded, each distinctive.' Emerson, he thinks, is noteworthy for his sweet, vital-tasting melody, rhymed philosophy, and amber-clear poems; Longfellow for rich color, graceful forms, and incidents, a competitor with the singers of Europe on their own ground; Bryant for pulsing the first interior verse-throbs of a mighty world; Whittier for the zeal, the moral energy that founded New-England. One can hardly assert hereafter that Whitman, the least satisfactory and the most original of all our poets, rejects and condemns the body corporate of American poets. It is unfortunate in the circumstances, that he has not presented his views upon more eminent American verse-writers, like Lowell, Stedman, Aldrich, Stoddard, and a few others. It is invariably pleasant to read the opinions, of poets upon poets. In one of his notes concerning Emerson, Whitman refers to the philosopher's condemnation—from a strict standpoint of morality—of that rather notorious and thoroughly objectionable poem, 'Children of Adam.' According to Emerson and most fine-sighted critics, the immorality of this poem is repulsive. Emerson argued on the subject with Whitman, who was not convinced. When Emerson asked him what he had to say in reply to arguments, Whitman—who is his own reporter here—said: 'Only that while I can't answer them at all, I feel more settled than ever to adhere to my own theory and exemplify it.' The question is, then, between Whitman and the public taste, and we believe that public taste will decide it sharply. If Whitman's theory of morality, which is, briefly, that everything can be uttered honestly in literature, should be accepted, there would no longer be any mystery in social relation, no charm of modesty in sexual intercourse. It is interesting, however, to read Whitman's opinion upon the question at first hand.</p> <p>There is some strong, practical writing in 'Democratic Vistas,' though the majority of persons who take up this book will turn their attention at once to the prefaces, all of them curious contributions to literature and more generally discussed than known. In the preface of 1855, which has aroused the most attentive consideration in England and throughout Europe, Whitman makes several aggressive assumptions. He asserts in the beginning that the Americans, of all the people of the earth, have the fullest poetical nature; that the United States are themselves a great poem. He declares, furthermore, that the American poets—meaning, of course, the poets of the future—are to inclose old and new, since ours is the race of races; they shall excite generosity and affection; they shall be cosmos. The boldest statement in this preface is the following radicalism: 'Exact science and its practical movements are no checks on the greatest poet, but always his encouragement and support.' In the preface of 1872 Whitman adds eloquently: 'The mighty present age! To absorb and express in poetry anything of it—of its world—America—cities and States—the years, the events of our nineteenth century—the rapidity of movement—the violent contrasts, fluctuations of light and shade, of hope and fear—the entire revolution made by science in the poetic method—these great new underlying facts and ideas rushing and spreading everywhere—truly a mighty age.' Again, in the preface of 1876, he says: 'I count with such absolute certainty on the great future of the United States—different from, though founded on, the past—that I have always invoked that future, and surrounded myself with it, before or while singing my songs.' At the end of his article on 'Poetry To-day in America,' Whitman writes prophetically: 'Meanwhile, Democracy waits, the coming of its bards in silence and twilight—but 'tis the twilight of the dawn.'</p> <p>It is clear that Whitman's aspiration is noble and liberal, that his faith is founded in the history of humanity, and that his prophecy is the right prophecy of this 'mighty age'—mighty and wonderful though a hundred Ruskins, though a thousand Carlyles had launched their invective against its penetrating power. On the whole, Specimen Days is an important contribution to our literature.</p>
