<p>WALT WHITMAN.</p><p>My other item relates to one of whose merits as an author opinions differ widely. I refer to Walt Whitman, who has just published another edition of his much criticised and remarkable book, 'Leaves of Grass.' This last volume contains the original poems, with 'Drum Taps,' and some twenty others, later and fresher. The poet has returned to the practice of three centuries since and publishes his own works. This unique and original book can be obtained by addressing the author here and enclosing three dollars. The present edition is prefaced with the following 'Inscription,' which, as it gives a glimpse of the philosophy of these poems, and is moreover brief, I quote:</p><p>'Small is the theme of the following chaunt, yet the greatest—namely, ONE'S SELF—that wondrous thing, a simple, seperate person. That, that for the use of the New World, I sing.</p><p>'Man's physiology complete from top to toe, I sing. Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone is worthy of the muse—I say the form is worthier far. The female form equally with the male, I sing Nor cease at the theme of One's Self. I speak the word of the modern, the word EN MASSE.</p><p>'My days I sing, and the lands, with interstice I knew of hapless war.</p><p>'O friend, whoe'er you are, at last arriving here to commence, I feel through every leaf the pressure of your hand, which I return. And thus upon our journey link'd together let us go.'</p><p>The arrangement of this new volume will be attractive to those who have seen the old. In connection with the 'Good Gray Poet,' I am glad to mention that the author of that eloquent defence of Mr. Whitman against Mr. Harlan's proscription, is quietly resuming his place among the literati of the day. Mr. O'Connor will delight the readers of the Galaxy with some charming stories. Those who remember 'The Ghost Story' in Putnam, 'What Cheer' in Harpers', and his rich and affluent romance of 'Harrington,' will be grateful for this announcement. Mr. O'Connor is reported as preparing a literary lecture, which, if true, will be a great treat for those who listen. There is no young author and scholar so eminently adapted to that field as the one of whom I write.</p><p>OBSERVER.</p><p>Perhaps a steady and unshaken faith in one's self—what we call self-reliance—has as much to do with a man's success in what he undertakes as any other single quality. This faith Walt Whitman certainly has in an amazing degree; perhaps no man ever wrote with so much assurance and so regardless of the opinions of the mass of his contemporaries. In his recent little volume, called Drum Taps, occur these lines:—</p><p>I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever have been had all accepted me;<br> I heed not, and have never heeded, either experience, cautions, majorities, nor ridicule.</p><p>The following from Leaves of Grass is to the same purport:—</p><p>Not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port, though beaten back, and many times baffled;<br>Not the path-finder, penetrating inland, weary and long,<br>By deserts parched, snows chilled, rivers wet, perseveres till he reaches his destination,<br>More than I have charged myself, heeded or unheeded, to compose a free march for these States,<br>To be exhilarating music to them years, centuries hence.</p><p>He has worked away like a man building something, the plan or character of which none foresaw, but which he had deliberately settled upon; and amid the jeers and ridicule of the crowd has gone on adding stroke after stroke, part after part, as serenely and good-naturedly as if the rest of mankind were clapping their hands in applause.</p><p>As his work approaches, or perhaps has arrived at, completion in this new edition, it turns out that the thing he has been building so long is a man—a new democratic man, whom he believes to be typical of the future American, and of whom he perpetually uses himself as the illustration.</p><p>The 'Inscription,' which is one of the new features of this edition, says as much:—</p><p>Small is the theme of the following chant, yet the greatest—namely, ONE'S SELF—that wonderous thing, a simple, separate person. That, for the use of the New World, I sing.<br>Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the muse; I say the form complete is worthier far. The female equally with the male, I sing.<br>Nor cease at the theme of One's Self. I speak the word of the modern, the word EN-MASSE.<br>My days I sing, and lands—with interstice I knew of hapless war.<br>O friend, whoe'er you are, at last arriving hither to commence, I feel through every leaf the pressure of your hand, which I return. And thus upon our journey link'd together let us go.</p><p>This passage, 'To a Historian,' also contains a valuable hint toward understanding the purpose of the author:—</p><p>You who have celebrated bygones!<br>Who have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races —the life that has exhibited itself;<br>Who have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates, rulers and priests;<br>I, habitué of the Alleghanies, treating man as he is in himself, in his own rights,<br>Pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself, (the great pride of man in himself;)<br>Chanter of personality, outlining what is yet to be, I project the history of the future.</p><p>The arrangement of the pieces, as they stand in the new volume, favors this view. The first poem, 'Walt Whitman,' which is a compend of the book, has for its central purpose, perhaps, to show how a man is made; what elements and experiences contribute to him, and how wide the field from which he may draw nutriment. It is a search after power—a ransacking of heaven and earth for something to try himself on—to measure himself against. He would soar into heaven, he would dive into hell, to find himself—to be published of his own personality.</p><p>Following this poem comes a collection of pieces called 'Children of Adam,' in which the author celebrates amativeness and the principle of sex. It is these poems which have given so much offense. They have most likely been very much misunderstood. The poet attempts to do justice to every part of a strong, healthy, unconventional man. In these pieces he shows us his hero mostly as a breeding animal—for the moment giving free swing to his animal nature. When we reflect that this animal nature is the basis of all else—is the very ground under our feet—we can pardon this attitude of the poet toward it, particularly as he has done an equal proportionate justice to the moral and aesthetic qualities, and has not unduly exalted any part.</p><p>The poems called 'Calamus,' which follow, celebrate a riper and more mature feeling, namely, manly affection and the need of comrades. 'Salut au monde,' or, Health to the World! shows the geniality and good wishes of America toward all other nations, till, in the pieces which follow, the high intellectual powers are fully recognized and unfolded:—</p><p>I have said many times that materials and the soul are great, and that all depends on physique;<br>Now I reverse what I said, and affirm that all depends on the aesthetic, or intellectual,<br>And that criticism is great—and that refinement is greatest of all;<br>And I affirm now that the mind governs—and that all depends on the mind.</p><p>The 'Song of the Broad Axe' and 'To Working-Men' comprise most of those poems which, in other editions, were arranged under the head of 'Chants Democratic.' The Sun-down poem, which Thoreau admired so much, comes near the close of the volume. This poem represents the soul in an attitude of worship or adoration. Having examined the world and the men and women in it, having tasted and tried all things, it finds all perfect, and that there are and can be no conceivable failures:—</p><p>Splendor of ended day, floating and filling me!<br>Hour prophetic—hour resuming the past!<br>Inflating my throat—you, divine average!<br>You, earth and life, till the last ray gleams, I sing.<br>Open mouth of my soul, uttering gladness,<br>Eyes of my soul, seeing perfection,<br>Natural life of me, faithfully praising things;<br>Corroborating forever the triumph of things.</p><p>The 'Song of the Open Road' shows the man about at maturity. It is a magnificent poem. The newer collection called Drum Taps, which this volume now includes, and which is the poet's latest work, comes near the close of the volume, as it ought. These poems, taken in connection with the author's services in the army-hospitals during the war, form a sort of coloring or atmosphere through which his entire work is to be read. Their chief feature is their humanity, and they are unspeakably precious in filling out and completing the idea of the work. They sanctify and make beautiful, like a great heroic act, everything in the author's previous life or previous poems.</p><p>Walt Whitman has at last justified himself. As he has surpassed all others in rude force and virility, he has surpassed all others in tenderness and love. All his 'hairy Pelasgic strength,' all his vast abysmal power, have at last blossomed into a benevolence such as was never before the inspiration of poems.</p><p>Walt Whitman.</p><p>We publish the following Review of Leaves of Grass by WALT WHITMAN, of which a new edition has just been issued, not because we accept it as a just critical estimate of that book, but because it is written with very marked ability, and embodies the opinions of a very competent and accomplished writer. He regards WALT WHITMAN as distinctively and transcendently the representative Poe of America-as holding to American literature the same relation as HOMER holds to Greek literature, DANTE to Italian, and SHAKESPEARE to English. Without denying the justice of this claim, certainly without questioning the sincerity and earnestness with which it is pressed by critics of eminence and ability, we may certainly be pardoned for saying that the study we have given to these writings, not profound nor complete, we admit, has not disclosed to us the grounds on which it can be vindicated and sustained. We do certainly recognize in some of WHITMAN'S poems, especially in those written since and upon the war, and notably in that noble, almost unrivalled hymn on the funeral procession of LINCOLN, beginning 'When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed,' some of the loftiest and most beautifully majestic strains ever sounded by human meditation. Perhaps these may and should give character to the whole, as it is the right of the artist to be judged by his best; but we have not yet come to believe that even these poems, grand as they are, justify the great claims put forth on their author's behalf. Nor can we fail to note that while he sometimes thus soars aloft in the very highest regions of thought and song, WALT WHITMAN often also wallows exultingly in unredeemed and irredeemable indecency and filth. His code of nature and of genius may justify him in thinking and feeling, and perhaps in writing, upon this level, but he has no right to expect that other men and women shall keep him company in so doing. Until the social circle, the dinner table and the fireside are deemed fitting theatres for every topic and for every set for which the sanction of Nature can be invoked, this volume cannot be accepted as fit for the audience which it seeks and claims. With this partial protest, we submit the able and interesting review of our contributor.</p><p>—————</p><p>There is a touch of comedy in the fact that, despite the roar of angry criticism which has met its former successive stages and appearances, another and a much fuller growth of this hardy volume has just made its appearance, challenging a notice at our hands, in addition to the two extensive ones given in past years in these columns.</p><p>It is certain that in this new edition the plan and theory of the author appear more distinctly and to greater advantage than before. The equal certainty of the great merits of the book, whatever its demerits may be, and the nobility of the writer's intentions and object, joined with his well-known career during the war, would seem to require of journalism not only respect, but the more favorable forms of interpretation; and this the writer can give, out of a long and hearty accretion of good-will toward the poem and its author, derived from repeated and deliberate scrutiny of both, extending through several years.</p><p>The book is, perhaps, the most astounding one of the age. It has much to perplex, much to cause widely different opinions. During its existence of ten years, it has called forth in high quarters vehement denunciation and even disgust; and again, from quarters equally high, defence and advocacy yet more vehement. It has not been left to itself, at any rate, and cannot be. It is widely known at home and abroad. It is read and appreciated in London, in Paris, in Rome, and there is a quiet yet real stratum of attention, and even devotion, to it in American society, which, though it does not often crop out into print, is nevertheless potent.</p><p>We have not, of course, the slightest wish to defend or excuse in these columns, what may, and from certain points of view, what must appear as serious blots upon the author's performance, as they must upon the works of HOMER, of SHAKESPEARE, of DANTE and JUVENAL; but we think it would be idle to deny that this is the only book in our literature which aims at a distinctively national character and a high classic importance and performance; and leaving the discussion of blemishes to others, aware that we perceive at least in some measure the reason for them in the work, let ours bet the pleasanter task of offering a few comments in the spirit of appreciative exposition or interpretation, which, after all, is the spirit that best becomes a critic.</p><p>The book, as just said, has been noticed before in these columns, but its general quality and character and the lodgment it has achieved, make fresh mention always proper; and moreover, the new arrangement and revision of this (the fourth) edition, and the copious additions of new verse, most of which relates to the war, give to it something of the character of an original publication.</p><p>This, we hear the reader exclaim, is rank Materialism; and, using the word in its big sense, Materialism it doubtless is. We shall observe, further on, in what consists the peculiar value of the present manifestation. In the meantime, we must continue our survey of the work.</p><p>Evidences of a wide and multifarious learning, rather concealed than displayed, and oftenest dissolved into the intelligence; of a long and intimate experience of life and men, and a patient and loving study of things; and of a purpose, deep as existence and as earnest and fervent as ever inspired man, are what one sees readily upon first glancing over the volume. Add, as among the special gifts of the author, a singularly vivid and creative imagination, a quality of mind which perceives with sublest insight things in their simple verity, without coloring or exaggeration, a skill to command the higher harmonies of verse, and a mastery, truly wonderful, of all the resources of language.</p><p>The author is the third of note who appears as the central and paramount figure of his own creation. The first is DANTE. But throughout the scenery, terrific or celestial, of the Divina Comedia, the great Tuscan moves only pictorially or as an object. The second is MONTAIGNE. Here the presentation is not only of the corporeal appearance but of the mental being also, and the short, able-bodied old Gascon sits for us in his study, as STERLING has pictured him, conveyed to our perception by a series of sharp and daring strokes, and also merges at times into our consciousness, becoming our intellectual selves. In WALT WHITMAN'S treatment, with his Democratic philosophy of Egoism, there are points of analogy to MONTAIGNE'S, but the conception and presentation are for more relieved and vivid, besides being inclusive to a degree unprecedented in literature. In the art or plan of his book, like the others, he makes the central figure, but he appears not only physiognomically, but psychologically and physiologically. There is, perhaps, in poetry, no equal celebration of the human being in his completeness-in his organic character-every part necessary to every other and to the whole,—a mutuality of means and ends. Spiritually, mentally, corporeally, a complete form, he glows, glorified in all his nature, upon the student of the volume. The reader seems to himself to be in company with some tremendous living man. There is an immense sense of space in the book. There is an equally immense spread of salient and world-wide scenery, and a sustained impression of time, as from birth to age and death. There is also a world of event, circumstance, vicissitude, the superb shows of peace, the tragic sceneries of war, and a swarm of personal hopes, dreams, observations, memories, speculations, prophecies, in which the highest themes are involved. But, through all the dazzling interradiation of sights and sounds, the pageant cosmorama of the nights and days, the gorgeous profusion of picturings, the swift and flashing cascading of thoughts, fancies, imaginations, images, poured forth with all the lavish richness of genius, the main figure of the organic man, complete, full-blooded, ample of body and soul, haughty, affectionate, electrical, powerfully projected in living form to the senses of the imagination, moves steadily with vivid prominence from beginning to end. The divine, the diabolic, the human, which are in all of us, are in him. The whole conception is in the highest spirit of that scientific verity which makes great poems. Its objects, as presented, are obvious. It aims to fix, in living art, an example, a model of manly being, operant upon the imaginations of men, for the use of the future of America, while, at the same time, it presents to the world, in one bold figure, the interpretation of the average historical American. Beyond this, it becomes a representative embodiment of the whole human nature, and seeks to express the cosmical character of the individual-yourself; the absolute miracle you are in all your parts from top to toe; your absolute sanctity; your wondrousness, eternity, priceless value; your centrality in the universe; all things, good and evil alike, being from your suppliance, your benefit, your development-in one word, the basic idea of Democracy.</p><p>This magnificent projection of the male also includes the female. And though it may be said that all the great works of absolute genius from VYASA and HOMER down, infer-as genius, which is another name for insight, must-the equality of woman with man, it is certain, and capable of the strictest demonstration, that never before has that equality been asserted in poetry till this volume, nor has woman ever met with a treatment so broadly and distinctly honorable. No more a toy, an invalid, a child, a fashion-plate, an odalisque, a gentle dependent, a delicate and charming subordinate, a caressed and courted being, without a flag or a land, she appears here adult; full grown; strong in her own right; powerful in womanly charms; manly and the equal of man; cultured, athletic and noble; crowned with the civic dignity; an American; a citizen; consubstantial with the pride, the ambition, the love and glory of her country. Wherever she appears in the book, she appears augustly. She is the matrix of all. As she is, so man is:</p><p>Unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded, and is always to come unfolded;<br>Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth is to come the superbest man of the earth.</p><p>******</p><p>Unfolded out of the justice of the woman, all justice is unfolded;<br>Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy;<br>A man is a great thing upon the earth, and through all eternity—but every jot of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman.</p><p>The same large justification of woman appears in this rich and tender Homeric picture:</p><p>Behold a woman.<br>She looks out from her Quaker cap—her face is clearer and more beautiful than the sky.<br>She sits in an arm-chair, under the shaded porch of the farm-house;<br>The sun just shines on her old white head.<br>Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen;<br>Her grandsons raised the flax, and her grand-daughters spun it with the distaff and the wheel.<br>The melodious character of the earth,<br>The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go, and does not wish to go,<br>The justified mother of men!</p><p>What ideal of womanly character in literature reaches the sublime and severe height of this?</p><p>Her shape arises;<br>She, less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever;<br>The gross and soiled she moves among do not make her gross and soiled;<br>She knows the thoughts as she passes,nothing is concealed from her;<br>She is none the less considerate and friendly therefor;<br>She is the best beloved—it is without exception—she has no reason to fear, and she does not fear;<br>Oaths, quarrels, hiccupp'd songs, smutty expressions, are idle to her as she passes;<br>She is silent—she is possess'd of herself—they do not offend her;<br>She receives them as the laws of nature receive them—she is strong;<br>She too is a law of nature—there is no law stronger than she is.</p><p>The assertion of the august power and equality of the woman with the man is also involved in the grand statement, full of the spirit of America, which projects the ideal city:</p><p>Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards;<br>Where the city stands that is beloved by these, and loves them in return, and understands them;<br>Where no monuments exist to heroes, but in the common words and deeds;<br>Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place;<br>Where the men and women think lightly of the laws;<br>Where the slave ceases and the master of slaves ceases;<br>Where the populace rise at once against the never-ending audacity of elected persons;<br>Where fierce men and women pour forth, as the sea to the whistle of death pours it sweeping and unript waves;<br>Where outside authority enters always after the pre cedence of inside authority;<br>Where the citizen is always the head and ideal—and President, Mayor, Governor, and what not, are agents for pay;<br>Where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on themselves;<br>Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs;<br>Where speculations on the soul are encouraged;<br>Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same as the men;<br>Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men;<br>Where the city of the faithfullest friends stands;<br>Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands;<br>Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands<br>Where the city of the best-bodied mothers stands;<br>There the grand city stands.</p><p>The citation of these lines suggests what must strike every candid reader of the volume—the absolute correspondence the latter bears in the form, substance and atmosphere with this country. The vast and often terrific energy, the electrifying or silent power, as of the thunder or the ray; the novel and colossal beauty which at every step startles and awes the appreciative student of these pages, are only signs and expressions of the close historic relation the book holds to the present of America. ' In history,' says Emerson, in one of his grandest passages, 'the great moment is when the savage is just ceasing to be a savage, with all his hairy pelasgic strength directed on the opening sense of beauty; and you have Pericles and Phidias, not yet passed over into the Corinthian civility. Everything good in nature and the world is in that moment of transition, when the swarthy juices still flow plentifully from nature, but their astringency or acidity is got out by ethics and humanity.' America, with her aboriginal forest just dissolving and mingled with the gorgeous shows of empire, evidences the arrival of this moment, and WALT WHITMAN is its expression in literature.</p><p>It is a prime characteristic of vast poems that their structure and quality involve the whole account of their respective countries. They contain all.</p><p>Give OWEN but one bone, and he will rebuild the vanished pterodactylus or the mastodon. Destroy every record, every fragment, and with Juvenal in his hand, NIEBUHR or BECKER will restore Rome. HOMER and ESCHYLUS incorporate Greece. HAFTZ is the soul of Persia. Under the vast banyan of Vyasa—under the enormous fronds of the Makabharata—spreads in gorgeous profusion of fact and dream, the life of India. LUCRETIUS contains antique Italy. SHAKESPEARE holds in precipitation England and Europe. CERVANTES includes Spain. All France is in RABELAIS. All Italy is in DANTE. In like manner, and with equal obviousness, WALT WHITMAN is a condensed encyclopedia of America. The universe, shadowed forth in his poems, is the background from which juts the tremen-alto-relievo of his country. If America sank tomorrow, and nothing survived on the float but this volume, the historian could tell the ages from its leaves, what was the nature and quality, the forms and shows, the essential verities of our democratic civilization.</p><p>This may not be perceived at first, though the fact is really a very plain one. Indeed, Mr. WHITMAN'S book may not be understood at all for a long time. Nature and Art alike often seem chaotic and incomprehensible, must receive patient consideration before they render up their meanings, and wait for ages for their interpretors. The physical cosmos cooled its heels a good while before HUMBOLDT arrived. It took two hundred years to understand SHAKESPEARE, whom the Germans finally excavated, making England a present of her own poet. No wonder if a similar fate is in store for the American man who has done what no one else thought worth doing, namely, celebrated his own country. But that he has done so, and that his book contains the whole theory of this nation, and has Democracy for its central thought, as Europe for her literature has Feudality, and proceeds solely, though with deference to the past, and to other civilizations, from the American historic movement, and faithfully and adequately mirrors the full life and vicissitude of this land and time, no candid and intelligent student of the work can fail to perceive. It is not the poem of a section or a locality, but of the whole Union. Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Illinois, California, are in it the same as New-York or New-England. It is good for any of our latitudes, implies them all, might have been written in any, only could not have been written abroad, and is the only one of our books which dislinks utterly from the principle, spirit and life of 'enemies' lands.' The lingering attachment of our seaboard to Europe is not in it. It breathes throughout the Western independence. In it appears for the first time in literature, that new fact, a regnant people—the Americans, turbulent, generous, sovereign; their genius never expressed by their deputies, but always by themselves; the pulse of their life and rule not in any external influence or circumstance, but in their own developed love and pride. Its thought is everywhere the thought of Democracy—the doctrine that everything is for the individual—the theory that the office of society, government, the universe itself, is to produce great persons. All that DE TOCQUEVILLE attempted, with great success and partial failure, in analysis of American Democracy, WALT WHITMAN has triumphantly cast in poetic synthesis, sometimes in electric sentences of affirmation, sometimes in expressive dramatic or verbal pictures. No book we have could so possess a foreigner with a profound knowledge of this country and people, and the democratic passion which animates the whole. DE TOCQUEVILLE is a good spy-glass; but he who dwells resolutely in the atmosphere of Leaves of Grass, and masters its massive and subtle sense, will know America not from without like an observer, but from within like a citizen.</p><p>The thorough Americanism of the poem, permeating every part of it, appears as well in its literary form or rhythmus. This, not being capable of scansion by the laws of prosodies of antique Greece and Rome and modern Europe—prosodies which ESCHYLUS, LUCRETIUS, DANTE and SHAKESPEARE accept only to violate whenever they choose—has been pronounced unpoetical by reviewers who forget that poetry is a quality of thought mainly, and not a form of expression merely—that poetry may even be in prose; and whose theory of poetical expression, logically carried out, would shove OSSIAN and HORACE, EZEKIEL and ISAIAH, and Davidic Psalms and the Song of SOLOMON, into the dust-bin of failures.</p><p>A catholic critic has to remember Lord BACON'S maxim, that 'in poetry, however some may tie themselves to the ancient forms, it is as lawful to devise new measures as new dances, and in these things the sense is a better judge than the art.' Opposed, too, to these gentlemen, we had not long ago an eminent English critic and Orientalist complimenting Mr. WHITMAN on the delicacy of his musical ear, and the melodiousness and beauty of his versification. The same critic assorted the similarity of the latter with that of the masterpieces of Persian poetry. The similarity is certainly apparent, as it also is to the poetic diction of the Hebraic muse, yet in both cases it is more apparent than real. The truth is, that the rhythmus of Leaves of Grass, with its occasional ruggedness, its often wild-bird melody, its always eolian and oceanic cadences, its novelty, flowing liquidity, audacity, simplicity, flexibility and liberty, is not merely an admirable and profoundly artistic form for the conveyance of epical intellections, whose glad and vast sublimity and rough grandeur would be illy expressed by the tintinnabluating minuets of Tennysonian metres, but is also a form corresponsive in all its qualities with the tumultuous, composite and gigantic life and movement of America. Apart from this, it is a rhythmus whose tally in nature is in the forms of trees or hills, the sweep and subsidence of billows, the cadences of winds, in which there is no regularity, but perfect harmony. In art, its analogy is in the complex and daring music of grand operas and symphonies-so unintelligible and unpleasing to persons whose ear is trained only to mere melody or tune. But the artist will own that the last secret of musical expression is realized in the 'Word Out of the Sea,' or in the unexcelled strains, sombre and wild and tender, and stirring the soul like a harmony of BEETHOVEN'S, in the grand dirge of LINCOLN, 'When Lilacs last in the Dooryard Bloomed,' in the sound as in the sense of which all requiems and hossanahs seem to blend.</p><p>How truly this sensitive and colossal poet has absorbed the spirit of this country, appears strikingly in the poems evoked by the war. The same august theory of democracy makes their inspiration, and solitary among all poems, singing of war, they conform to the spirit of the modern ages and to the genius of this land. The once permanent fact of civilization, the warrior, is not in them; instead appears the modern fact, the armed citizen. They celebrate no general, no leader, no master-brain, marshaling obedient hosts to conflict, for such Democracy has not seen and cannot see; they celebrate instead the immense truth—a people rising as one man at the tap of the war-drum to fight for the idea of their land, and victory torn from the tremendous struggle simply and solely by the public spirit, the valor and endurance of the rank and file. And finally, they are greatest precisely where they have disappointed most and been most criticized—viz., in their presentation of the war only in its tragic and ghastly aspects, or in those which develop the beautiful relations of patriotism and comradeship, or the spectacles of human love and sorrow; and also in their utter abstinence from any vindictiveness during the struggle, any note of exultation over the vanquished, or any feeling incompatible with the theory on which this country rests—the permanent love and union of the whole people. The poet's view in these respects must be considered noble and profound; for war in the nineteenth century, always to be promptly undertaken for the good cause, must always be undertaken mournfully, and, as war, must always be regarded with sorrow; and those with whom we lately fought, however misguided, however bedeviled, were still our countrymen. The poet never forgets it. Utterly true to liberty and democracy, his is also true to country and humanity; and in the battle, the hospital, amidst the carnage, in scenes of loss and agony and horror, among the torn bodies of the dying and the dead, his spirit moves with the divine yearnings of maternity—the Madonna tenderness, the mother's unutterable love and woe. Not what he, as the typical poet, brings America in the supreme hour of her triumph, when she stands, as he conceives her, stupendous and lovely in victory, and all the other poets are exulting:</p><p>Lo! Victress on the peaks!<br>Where thou standest, with mighty brow, regarding the world,<br>(The world, O Libertad, that vainly conspired against thee;)<br>Out of its countless, beleaguering toils, after thwarting them all;<br>Where thou, dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,<br>Towerest now unharm'd, in immortal soundness and bloom—lo! in this hour supreme,<br>No poem proud, I, chanting, bring to thee—nor mastery's rapturous verse;<br>But a little book, containing night's darkness, and blood-dripping wounds,<br>And psalms of the dead.</p><p>The picturesque side of the war gets full justice, as in pieces like 'Cavalry Crossing a Ford,' full of the very essence that makes HOMER immortal:</p><p>A line in long array, where they wind betwixt green islands;<br>They take a serpentine course—their arms flash in the sun—Hark to the musical clank;<br>Behold the silvery river—in it the splashing horses, loitering, stop to drink;<br>Behold the brown-faced men—each group, each person, a picture—the negligent rest on the saddles;<br>Some emerge on the opposite bank—others are just entering the ford;<br>The guidon flags flutter gaily in the wind.</p><p>Here every idiosyncrasy of the scene is caught, and makes the vividness and truth of the picture. So in pieces like 'The Veteran's Vision,' with its exciting glimpses of the engagement. But such scenes, and all that might tend to render the conflict attractive, are retired or veiled, as they should be, and the purely human element, utterly opposed to the devilish joy of battle, is kept in supremacy. Sometimes, as in 'By the Bivouac's Fitful Flame,' the thought moves to noble music in a soldier's reverie of home and the past and loved; sometimes, as in 'The Dresser,' the appalling scenery of the hospital opens; sometimes, as in the exquisite, sad idyl, 'Come up from the Fields, Father,' the commonest and keenest sorrow of the land finds voice; or we have some divine picture of the dead in camp or on the battle field; or the grand continental Western chant of progress and glory, 'Pioneers, O Pioneers!'—or the rapt prophecy of the victory of the flag of man over the flag of kings; or a requiem, too noble for words, too beautiful for praise, like the 'Hymn for Dead Soldiers:</p><p>******</p><p>Faces so pale, with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet;<br>Draw close, but speak not.<p><p>Phantoms welcome, divine and tender,<br>Invisible to the rest, henceforth become my companions;<br>Follow me ever! desert me not, while I live.<p><p>Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living! sweet are the musical voices surrounding!<br>But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead, with their silent eyes.</p><p>Dearest comrades! all now is over;<br>But love is not over—and what love, O comrades!<br>Perfume from battle-fields rising—up from foetor arising.</p><p>Perfume, therefore, my chant, O Love! immortal Love!<br>Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers.</p><p>Perfume all! make all wholesome!<br>O love! O chant! solve all with the last chemistry.</p><p>Give me exhaustless—make me a fountain,<br>That I exhale love from me wherever I go,<br>For the sake of all dead soldiers.</p><p>The whole should be quoted. No elegy could be more exquisite. It is the very rapture of mournful and abiding love, and it is love consecrate of the people, so little remembered in the affection of poets. Yet the same cloud from which shines these tender moonlight rays, can let fly the rattling bursts of thunder which reverberate through such songs as that the poet sings 'By Blue Ontario's Shore'—a poem whose interpretation of America is fitly matched by the majesty and passion of its diction. Look at this tremendous tableau of Libertad with Slavery beneath her:</p><p>Lo! high-toward Heaven, this day,<br>Libertad! from the conqueress' field returned,<br>I mark the new aureols around your head;<br>No more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,<br>With war's flame, and the lambent lightnings playing<br>And your port immovable where you stand<br>With still the inextinguishable glance, and the clench'd and lifted fist<br>And your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner, utterly crush'd beneath you;<br>The menacing, arrogant one, that strode and advanced with his senseless scorn, bearing the murderous knife;<br>Lo! The wide-swelling one, the braggart, that would yesterday do so much!<br>To-day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth,<br>An offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurned.</p><p>Not less powerful and grand is this annunciation of the mission of poets:</p><p>For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals;<br>For that idea the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,<br>The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots.</p><p>Without extinction is Liberty! Without retrograde is Equality!<br>They live in the feelings of young men, and the best women;<br>Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always ready to fall for Liberty.</p><p>For the great Idea!<br>For that we live, my brethren—that is the mission of Poets.</p><p>With their poems of stern defiance, ever ready,<br>With songs of the rapid arming and the march,<br>And the flag of peace quick folded, and the song, instead, of the flag we know,<br>The flag of the youths and veterans—flaunting flag,<br>Warlike flag of the great Idea!</p><p>Angry cloth I saw there leaping!<br>I stand again in the leaden rain, your flapping folds saluting;<br>I sing you over all, flying, beckoning through the fight—O, the hard-contested fight!<br>O, the cannons ope their rosy-slashing muzzles! the hurtled balls scream!<br>The battle-front forms amid the smoke—the volleys pour incessant from the line;<br>Hark! the ringing word, Charge! Now the tussle, and the furious, maddening yells,<br>Now the corpses tumble curled upon the ground,<br>Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,<br>Angry cloth I saw there leaping!</p><p>It is the flag of the great idea—it is the Stars and Stripes—which commands and owns all. The wonder is to see a patriotism so fervid and absolute united with such a breadth of universal and purely human sympathies. Patriotism is commonly pitiless; yet mark the heavenly compassion and acceptance of the poet's attitude over the dead enemy in the poem spanned by the word 'Reconciliation.'</p><p>Word over all, beautiful as the sky!<br>Beautiful that war, and all its deeds of carnage, must in time be utterly lost;<br>That the hands of the sisters Death and Might, incessantly softly wash again, and ever again, this soil'd world.</p><p>For my enemy is dead—a man divine as myself is dead;I look where he lies, white-faced and still in the coffin—I draw near;I bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin.</p><p>These are the strains to have produced which sweetens and ennobles victory. The thought of the comradeship of Americans is never absent from the poet's pages. Upon that he relies for the perpetuation of the Union. With love he will make the continent indissoluble. While others foster institutions with jealous care, he will make 'the institution of the dear love of comrades.' He proposes and predicts as the vital bond of America 'a superb friendship, exalte, previously unknown.' His dream is of a land of lovers and of friends. His statecraft is to saturate the imagination of the people with the thought of continental comradeship. Paper agreements, the lawyers, the puissance of arms, he sees cannot hold us together; only love. To inspire his countrymen with this is a central purpose of his volume. In this he believes, and even in the mad roar of civil slaughter his prophetic soul rises in magnificent and flowing music:</p><p>Over the carnage rose prophetic a voice,<br>Be not disheartened—affection shall solve the problems of freedom yet;<br>Those who love each other shall become invincible—they shall yet make Columbia victorious.</p><p>Sons of the Mother of All! you shall yet be victorious!<br>You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of the remainder of the earth.</p><p>No danger shall baulk Columbia's lovers;<br>If need be, a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one.</p><p>One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian's comrade;<br>From Maine and from hot Carolina, and another, an Organese, shall be friends triune.<br>More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth.</p><p>To Michigan Florida perfumes shall tenderly come;<br>Not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death!</p><p>It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly affection;<br>The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly;<br>The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,<br>The continuance of Equality shall be comrades.</p><p>These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron;<br>I, ecstatic, O partners! O lands! With the love of lovers tie you!</p><p>The German scholar, HEEBEN, finds in the Iliad of HOMER the bond that held together the States of Ancient Hellas. He is right, for the great poet alone is strong to give cohesion to a nation. Not substances, but phantoms lord it over us. Poland, dismembered by Europe, her every material interest involved in the Panslavic theory, which would bind her to Russia, resists resolutely, because, evoked from the heart of every Pole, towers one spectre, mournful and radiant, the august conception of nationality. Such are the ghosts that we own as sovereign. Arguments of adamant, logic of iron, defend and attack the doctrine of secession; and the mere intellect might wage the war forever. Behold! the light of a poetic thought is flung upon this square of bunting—it is a cloth no longer, but a flag; and in defence of it, Northerner and Southerner will vie with each other which shall die nearest the foe! Out of all things, the bard evokes the insubstantial phantom of a common country, clothed with the glory and beauty of motherhood, and the pulses of strong men tremble with instinctive devotion, and the famed doctrine of secession become a strengthless film! 'Man,' said NAPOLEON, 'is ruled by his imagination.' It is true, and let it be so in no degrading sense, for it is through the imagination that high truths are perceived. The conception of country is one of them. It must remain an enduring part of the glory of our poet, that, as in such superb and powerful lines as we have quoted, he has bent all the force of his genius to strengthen this conception; to reinforce the great doctrines of the Republic, in all their sternness and tenderness; to make every alien or hostile face in the likeness of the ideal America; and that he has striven by sowing broadcast the strong thoughts and imaginings which spring up again in the forms of countrymen and lovers, to give to the States of America the cohesion and union HOMER gave to the States of the Hellenic confederacy.</p><p>W.D.O'C.</p><p>(For the Saturday Press.)</p><p>'DRUM-TAPS.'</p><p>———</p><p>Few persons, we imagine, have read the much over-praised, as well as greatly underrated writings of Walt Whitman, without a conviction that their author is a genuine poet, although they may not agree with his more enthusiastic critics in ranking him above all of the moderns, and finding his true place beside Isaiah, Ezekiel and Job. It is impossible to sympathize heartily with the greatest thoughts that have found utterance in literature, and not to admire; him. The two ideas which have him in their possession,—the omnipresence of; the soul, and the sacredness of the individual—lie at the roots of poetry and civilization; and he chants them with an invincible faith, which is, of itself, sufficient to place him on a plane beyond that of the poets who believe in art as a finality.</p><p>But to be a Pantheist and a Democrat, does not constitute a claim sufficient to entitle any man to the distinction of being a great poet; and Walt Whitman has no other, save a picturesqueness of phrase unsurpassed in literature, and a powerful rhythm, whose long musical roll is like that of the waves of the sea. For he is not a man of ideas. What is called his sanity, his tenacious grasp on realities, is, after all, the monomania of a man whom a great thought has robbed of his self-possession. The unity of the soul is a key that unlocks all doors, but Walt Whitman stopped at the first one to which he applied it. He celebrates the divinity of matter, and worships the shells of things with such fervor that he almost persuades us that there is no substance behind them. It is a dangerous error. The sphinx, Matter, stands in her terrible beauty before every soul, and no answer to her riddle is more fatal than this. Whisper to her that she is divine, and her smiling lips open surely for your destruction. The idea which led Oriental thinkers to the life of contemplation, and which gives Emerson a serenity like that of the unclouded summer sky, leads this poet to materialism. His songs, though beautiful and inspiring, smack too strongly of the earth. His suggestions are sometimes vast, but himself is chaotic and fragmentary. The truth is that the two ideas which find expression through him are antagonistic. Because the soul is one and all mighty, the individual is nothing. 'I want no masses at all,' says Emerson; but in Whitman the passion for individuals is so strong that it continually wrestles with and overthrows his belief in the universal. Democracy is a good thought to found a state upon, but it is not the profoundest basis for a poem.</p><p>Jefferson may claim that 'all men are born free and equal,' and Whitman may 'accept nothing which all cannot have the counterpart of on the same terms;' but the soul, which does not divide itself impartially through the whole universe, but incarnates itself wholly in each atom, is an aristocrat—does not whiffle about rights and duties—claims all and will not be hindered of its own. Mr. Gradgrind's facts, Walt Whitman's patriotism, the vilest man, the purest saint, are equally sacred, and equally valueless, for they are the stepping- stones only, to the unattainable beyond. Let any man assume the attitude of adoration, no matter how fair the shrine, and his shell instantly hardens around him. And porous as this poet thinks himself to all the influences of the universe, he is prostrated, deaf, dumb and blind, before an idol from which the god has departed.</p><p>And yet, as Thoreau said, he suggests at times something more than human. In his latest volume there are a few passages which contain the very essence of poetry, and are inexpressibly pathetic, moreover, with the yearning humanity that breathes through them. Setting aside his war chants, which are remarkable for nothing but the startling vividness of their pictures, there are certain poems which make one doubt the correctness of the impression made by the whole man. Such, for instance, are the invocation to Death in the poem called 'When last in the dooryard the lilacs bloomed [sic],' 'Chanting the Square Deific,' and 'As I lay with my head in your lap.' If his faith in the unseen were more of a prophetic fury, and less a premeditated and coolly considered belief; if he clung closer to realities and less tenaciously to appearances, he would be the greatest poet of our day. But he hesitates, as he says, with a rare self-appreciation, at the first step in his progress. He shuts himself from hearty sympathy on all sides. His music, his picturesque force avail him little with the poets, while he so persistently produces poetical effects outside of the accepted rules of their art; and his vast ideas fail of half their force to those who, believing in them as faithfully as he, feel that his application of them is limited and material.</p><p>F.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN's DRUM TAPS New York, 1865. (Pp. 96.)</p><p>Such is the title of the latest volume of poems by a man of singular genius, Mr. Walter Whitman, of Brooklyn, N. Y. lately displaced from a humble clerkship in Washington by the husband of Mrs. Harlan. In it is included also a smaller collection of verses, called 'Sequel to Drum Taps,' and containing chiefly poems which relate to the death of President Lincoln and the close of the war. The poems called Drum Taps, as the name indicates, relate mostly to the beginning and the progress of the war. Before noticing at any length either these poems or their author, let us make a little comparison which is not without significance.</p><p>Mr. Whitman is a native of New York, a staunch patriot, and through the war, by his services to our soldiers in camp and hospital, has earned the gratitude of tens of thousands of the men who fought and died for their country. He has tenderly cared for the wounded, nursed the sick, consoled the dying and buried the dead. This he did not for pay or for glory—for he got neither—but for love of the sacred cause of freedom and of mankind. He had previously been known to many of his countrymen as a poet of original powers, occupied with the most important themes, which he did not always treat in conformity to the preconceived opinions of the multitude. Having served in his chosen work through the war, both before and after his appointment and dismissal from a clerkship at Washington, he sought in his native city a publisher for his patriotic verses, but he found none willing to put his name to the volume. Messrs. Bunce & Huntington finally printed it, but without their name, and without taking any of customary steps to introduce the book to the reading public. It is scarcely to be got at a bookstore, has hardly been noticed by a newspaper, and, though full of the noblest verses, is utterly unknown to the mass of readers.</p><p>Now, look at another fact. Mr. John Esten Cooke is a Virginian, who early joined the rebellion, in which his State played so prominent a part. He served in the army, and did his noble best to destroy the government and kill our brave soldiers. Being a writer, too, he aided his sword by his pen; and by what passes in Virginia for fine writing, he encouraged his fellow-traitors to prolong their treason. He had been known at the North, too, before the war, as a writer of trashy verses and sensational fiction.</p><p>Whether Mr. Cooke was pardoned by President Johnson at the urgency of Mrs. Cobb, or whether he is still unpardoned, (if he ever rose to the rank which made a pardon necessary,) we do not know. But he has had the effrontery to come to New York with a fourth-rate novel, written in the style of Mrs. Henry Wood, but full of the rankest treason and laudation of traitors, and he, too, has needed a publisher. But he did not wait long. Messrs. Bunce & Huntington, the same who treat Mr. Whitman so cavalierly, are eager to put his trash into the market. They announce it months in advance; they advertise it in all the newspapers; they send advance copies and secure long notices in the leading journals. The Advertiser devotes nearly a column to it; the Evening Post notices it at some length; the Round Table blows a trumpet before and behind it; and other journals pay it the courtesy of a serious review. Yet neither the author nor the book have any merit to be compared with Tupper and the Country Parson, while both are full of the vilest political heresy and bad taste.</p><p>This is the way we encourage poets and patriots; this is the way we reward them, and make treason odious!</p><p>Yet this displaced and slighted poet has written the most touching dirge for Abraham Lincoln of all that have appeared. Here it is copied from [the] volume before us:—</p><p><em>O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!</em><br>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;<br>The ship has weathered every rock, the prize we sought <br>is won.<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all <br>exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim <br>and daring;</p><p>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>Leave you not the little spot,<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the <br>bells;<br>Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the <br>bugle trills;<br>For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths—for you <br>the shores a-crowding;<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager<br> faces turning;</p><p>O Captain! dear father!<br>This arm I push beneath you;<br>It is some dream that on the deck<br>You've fallen cold and dead.</p><p>My captain does not answer, his lips are pale and <br>still,<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse <br>nor will;<br>But the ship, the ship, is anchored safe, its voyage <br>closed and done;<br>From fearful trip, the victor ship comes in with <br>object won.</p><p>Exult O shore, and ring O bells!<br>But I with mournful tread<br>Walk the spot my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>Compare with this, for poetic or pathetic feeling, Brownell's long monody, and the other good verses, and how superior that man's suggestive treatment.</p><p>We have quoted perhaps the most effective [illegible] poem in the book; but there are lines or passages in nearly all which are very striking. In the first poem, for instance, which gives its name to the volume, he describes the arming of New York when the news came of the attack on Fort [illegible]. 'The Lady of this teeming and turbulent city' calls forth her children as bees are called from the hive. She,</p><p>'At dead of night, at news from the South,<br>Incensed, struck with clenched hand the pave-<br>ment,—<br>A shock electric—the night sustained it,<br>Till with ominous hum, our hive at daybreak poured <br>out its myriads.'</p><p>One of the longer poems opens thus, with a melodious verse which yet does not come under any of the rules for English prosody:—</p><p>'When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed,<br>And the great star early drooped in the western <br>sky in the night,<br>I mourned—and yet shall mourn with ever retur-<br>ning spring.'</p><p>In the 'Dirge for Two Veterans' are these stanzas:—</p><p>'I see a sad procession,<br>And I hear the sound of coming full-keyed bugles;<br>All the channels of the city streets they're flooding<br>As with voices and with tears.</p><p>I hear the great drums pounding,<br>And the small drums steady whirring;<br>And every blow of the great convulsive drum<br>Strikes me through and through.</p><p>Now nearer blow the bugles,<br>And the drums strike more convulsively;<br>And the daylight o'er the pavement quite has faded,<br>And the strong dead-march enwraps me.'</p><p>We have quoted enough to show the power which this poet has to fix his thought in the mind at a single stroke. But what cannot so well be shown by quotations is the broad effect of his poems as a whole; as he says himself,</p><p>'The words of my book nothing, the life of it <br>everything.'</p><p>He has the power which Crawford had in sculpture, and which Church has in painting, of producing in his own way the feeling that the American landscape produces,—a vast and vague delight in the scope of existence on this western hemisphere. This was manifest in Leaves of Grass, but it is still more so here, where the sentiment is more concentrated by the national crisis in which the poems were written.</p><p>Like many of our best poets, however, he is too wilful, and does not conform himself with sufficient patience to the laws of rhythm and proportion in thought or expression. Consequently he is fitfully great, and pleases only at intervals in the details of his composition. He is often as tiresome as Wordsworth in his dull passages, and as rugged as an old English metrical romance. He is full of other faults, too, but they mostly spring from his wilfulness and impatience of rules.</p><p>The complaints made of his earlier poems, that they were coarse and immoral in passages, will not apply to this little volume, which is as free from reproach on this score as Mr. Harlan's hymn-book. It will do much, we are confident, to remove the prejudice against Mr. Whitman in many minds, and to secure him that place in literature during his lifetime which he is sure to hold in the next age.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN'S DRUM-TAPS.*</p><p>SAID Thoreau: 'The wisest definition of poetry the poet will instantly prove false by setting aside its requisitions.' This acute observation has never been more strikingly proved than by the author of the volume before us. The curious and the metaphysical have frequently essayed a complete and accurate definition of the word poetry; but it would be impossible to locate within any of their survey-bills, the strange pastures into which Walt Whitman leads his flocks. And yet the author of 'Leaves of Grass,' is as unquestionably a true poet, as the greatest of his contemporaries. He seems to us more purely permeated with the subtile essence of poetry than almost any other. It is the air he breathes: the very blood of his arteries. With others there are wide vistas of unmitigated prose in their view of life; to this poet, everything in the world is glowing with poetic beauty. Objects which seem so insignificant—so homely and common-place to most of us, he weaves into his poems. We would not, of course, be understood to say that a simple photography of whatever objects pass before us answers the ends of art. The hand which holds the pencil is everything; and all must be so portrayed that we view them from the poet's own high stand-point. This answers the artistic end; and it is vain to deny artistic treatment in Walt Whitman's poems because they are not constructed in accordance with canons previously laid down. The true poet discovers new and unsuspected laws of art, and makes his own rules. If he touches the secret chords of poetry in our soul, that is the only test, whether we can explain it to our own understanding or not.</p><p>'Drum-Taps' contains but few strikingly different characteristics from the author's former volume. We are pleased to find that certain features of that are not introduced in this; for we are compelled to confess that there were certain pages of the 'Leaves of Grass' which we regretted had been written. We have written upon the fly-leaf of our copy this passage from 'The Essays:' 'Osmand had a humanity so broad and deep, that although his speech was so bold and free with the Koran as to disgust all the dervishes, yet was there never a poor outcast, eccentric or insane man, some fool who had cut off his beard, or who had been mutilated under a vow, or had a pet madness in his brain, but fled at once to him: that great heart lay there so sunny and hospitable in the centre of the country, that it seemed as if the instinct of all sufferers drew them to his side.'</p><p>On looking through the pages of 'Drum-Taps,' and catching the soft and sweet strains of a sublime tenderness, much more than the martial music which the title indicates, certain scenes in Washington in the winter of '63 and '64 recur very vividly to memory; his meeting soldiers on the street whom he had nursed and tended—</p><p>'Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have crossed and rested—<br>Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips',—</p><p>walks with him through some of the hospitals, where he came a ministering spirit, daily. It was very affecting to witness the adoration which this divine love kindled. And it was somewhat amusing, too, to discover certain little myths which were afloat from bed to bed concerning him, for he was not known among them as writer or poet, and there seemed to be some mystery attached to his mission.</p><p>In this brief notice we have left little space for some extracts which we proposed to give. How striking a trope, for instance, is this!—</p><p>'One doubt, nauseous, undulating like a snake, crawl'd on the ground before me,<br>Continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically hissing low.</p><p>In vivid word-painting our poet has few equals, as these scattered lines, from 'The Veteran's Vision' show:</p><p>'The skirmishers begin—they crawl cautiously ahead—I hear the irregular snap! snap!I hear the sounds of the different missiles—the short t-h-t! t-h-t! of the rifle <br>balls;'</p><p>…'I hear the great shells shrieking as they pass;The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees.'….</p><p>'And ever the sound of the cannon, far and near, (rousing, even in dreams, a devilish exultation, and all the old mad joy, in the depths of my soul.)'</p><p>B.</p><p>———</p><p>∗ Published by the Author: New York.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN AND HIS 'DRUM TAPS.'</p><p>———</p><p>CONSIDERING the amount of adverse criticism that has been aimed at Walt Whitman for the last ten years, and the apparent security with which the public rests in the justness of its verdict concerning him, it certainly cannot be damaging to the cause of literature in America, where discussion and agitation in all things are the need of every hour, for us to set up a claim, in a mild way, illustrated by his recent publication called 'Drum Taps,' more favorable to this rejected and misinterpreted poet.</p><p>Moreover, the beautiful benevolence he has shown during the war in nourishing the sick and wounded soldiers, and his great love and humanity as exhibited in this little volume, entitle him, on grounds of justice alone, to more respect and consideration than he has hitherto received at the hands of his countrymen. He has been sneered at and mocked and ridiculed; he has been cursed and caricatured and persecuted, and instead of retorting in a like strain, or growing embittered and misanthropic, he has preserved his serenity and good nature under all, and illustrated the doctrine of charity he has preached by acts of the most pure and disinterested benevolence. Walt Whitman was born on Long Island, N. Y., in the Spring of 1819, and boasts that his tongue and every atom of his blood was formed from this soil, this air. 'Born here of parents born here, from parents the same and their parents' parents the same,' and hence, physiologically, is American to the very marrow of his bones.</p><p>On his father's side, his stock is English; on his mother's, Holland Dutch. From his father he inherits his large frame and muscular build—his antecedents here being a race of farmers and mechanics, silent, good-natured, playing no high part in society, politics or the church, and noted chiefly for strength and size. His early life was passed partly in Brooklyn and partly in the country about forty miles east of Brooklyn, where he lived much in presence of the sea. Between the ages of seventeen and twenty he seems to have been mostly engaged in teaching country schools in his native town and vicinity. It was about this time that he began writing for the press. His first productions, mostly sketches, appeared in the 'Democratic Review,' from which they were copied into some of the newspapers. Between the ages of twenty and thirty, he was variously occupied as writer and editor on the press of New York and Brooklyn, sometimes going into the country and delivering political addresses. During this period he was on familiar terms of acquaintance with William Cullen Bryant, and the two were in the habit of taking long walks, which, of course, were equivalent to long talks, in and about Brooklyn. In 1850 he went to New Orleans in the capacity of editor, where he remained a year. On his trip to and from that city he made it a point to penetrate various parts of the West and Southwest, particularly to explore the Mississippi and its tributaries, searching, one might say, for hints and models to be used in the making of his poems.</p><p>He does not seem to have conceived the idea of writing 'Leaves of Grass' till after his thirtieth year. How he was led to adopt this style of expression, thoroughly versed as he was in the literature of the day, is uncertain. The most probable explanation is, that he felt hampered by the old forms and measures, and saw that if America ever came to possess a style of her own it would be in the direction of more freedom and scope—a feeling in which many of his contemporaries are beginning to share. For three or four years before he began to write in this vein, and while his loaf was leavening, as it were, he was a diligent student of the critical literature of the age, delving into foreign magazines and quarterly reviews, and collecting together a vast amount of matter, bearing upon poetry and literature generally, for further use and study. It is quite probable that this course of reading had some influence in determining his own course as a poet, and that he knew well beforehand wherein the head and front of his offending would lie. It has not been with his eyes shut that he set himself squarely against the popular taste and standards, and wrote for an audience of which he did not count upon the present existence of a single member. It cannot be said with the same force of any other writer, living or dead, that he must 'wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of himself.'</p><p>When 'Leaves of Grass' was written and published, the author was engaged in putting up small frame houses in the suburbs of Brooklyn, partly with his own hands and partly with hired help. The book was still-born. To a small job printing office in that city belongs the honor, if such, of bringing it to light. Some three score copies were deposited in a neighboring book store, and as many more in another book store in New York. Weeks elapsed and not one was sold. Presently there issued requests from both the stores that the thin quarto, for such it was, should be forthwith removed. The copies found refuge in a well-known phrenological publishing house in Broadway, whose proprietors advertised it and sent specimen copies to the journals and to some distinguished persons. The journals remained silent, and several of the volumes sent to the distinguished persons were returned with ironical and insulting notes. The only attention the book received was, for instance, the use of it by the collected attachés of a leading daily paper of New York, when at leisure, as a butt and burlesque—its perusal aloud by one of the party being equivalent to peals of ironical laughter from the rest.</p><p>A small but important occurrence seems to have turned the tide. This was the appearance of a letter from the most illustrious literary man in America, brief, but containing a magnificent eulogium of the book. A demand arose, and before many months all the copies of the thin quarto were sold. At the present date, a curious person, poring over the shelves of second-hand book stalls in side places of the city, may light upon a copy of this quarto, for which the stall-keeper will ask him treble its first price. 'Leaves of Grass,' considerably added to, and printed in the new shape of a handy 16mo. of about 350 pages, again appeared in 1857. This edition also sold. The newspaper notices of it both here and in Great Britain were numerous, and nearly all of them scoffing, bitter and condemnatory. The most general charge made was that it had passages of serious indelicacy.</p><p>For the third time, now much enlarged and in a really beautiful typography and accompaniments, these 'Leaves' were issued in Boston as a 12mo. of 456 pages, in 1860. This is their last appearance. An edition of several thousand was taken up, but the business panic of the year, joined with the war, broke down the publishing house that had the book in hand, and the stereotype plates were locked up in chancery. We understand, however, that a new edition is now (August) in the hands of the printer and will shortly be given to the public. This edition will include 'Drum Taps,' and show many changes, both in the text and arrangement of the other poems, and indicate much more clearly the purpose or idea of the poet than any edition heretofore published. The entire carrying out of his plan, however, still contemplates the addition of a series of short pieces, like those called 'Calamus,' expressive of the religious sentiment and aspiration of man.</p><p>The full history of the book, if it could ever be written, would be a very curious one. No American work has ever before excited at once such diametrically opposite judgments, some seeing in it only matter for ridicule and contempt; others, eminent in the walks of literature, regarding it as a great American poem. Its most enthusiastic champions are young men, and students and lovers of nature; though the most pertinent and suggestive criticism of it we have ever seen, and one that accepted it as a whole, was by a lady—one whose name stands high on the list of our poets. Some of the poet's warmest personal friends, also, are women of this mould. On the other hand, the most bitter and vindictive critic of him of whom we have heard was a Catholic priest, who evoked no very mild degree of damnation upon his soul; if, indeed, we except the priestly official at the seat of government who, in administering the affairs of his department, on what he had the complacency to call Christian principles, took occasion, for reason of the poet's literary heresies alone, to expel him from a position in his office. Of much more weight than the opinion of either of these Christian gentlemen is the admiration of that Union soldier we chanced to hear of, who by accident came into possession of the book, and without any previous knowledge of it or its author, and by the aid of his mother wit alone, came to regard it with feelings akin to those which personal friendship and intercourse alone awaken; carrying it in his knapsack through three years of campaigning on the Potomac, and guarding it with a sort of jealous affection from the hands of his comrades.</p><p>It certainly is an astounding book; but if one will face it fairly, it is by no means so hopeless as it would seem. If the book as a whole means anything, it means power, health, freedom, democracy, self-esteem, a full life in the open air, an escape from the old forms and standards, and a declaration for new and enlarged modes, not only in letters, but in life. In other words, 'Leaves of Grass' is the expression in literature of a perfectly healthy, unconventional man; not an abstract, or an intellectual statement of him merely, but the full rendering of a human personality for better or for worse. The poet celebrates himself, that is, uses himself, as an illustration of the character upon which his book is predicated, and which he believes to be typical of the American of the future. This character he has mapped out in bold, strong lines, and in its interest has written his poems. Hence it is not for the man of to-day he has spoken; he has discarded the man of today as effete—has rejected his models and standards, and spoken for what he believes to be the man of the future. He must, therefore, have been well prepared for the reception he has met with. Is it to be expected that current conventionalities will endorse him who seeks their overthrow? If we see correctly, the book is also a terrible reaction against the petty, dainty, drivelling ways into which literature has fallen.</p><p>But to return to our account of the poet himself. Contrary to the hasty opinions of the critics, who mistook the personal element in his poems and their unliterary spirit (the spirit of nature and life is always unliterary) as evidence of the want of culture in their author, he is a man deeply learned in all the great literatures of the world. The Greek dramatists he has read as few moderns have, and knows Homer to his finger ends. The sects and commentators have not spoilt for him that greatest of books, the Bible, which he always has near. And his mastery of the German metaphysicians has not barred his mind to the enjoyment of the other extreme of literature; the stores of ballad poetry, as the Spanish songs of the 'Cid,'1 and Walter Scott's 'Border Minstrelsy,'2 which last is a source of never-failing delight to him. Considering how the critics have fathered him on Emerson, it is valuable to know that he did not make the acquaintance of Emerson's mind till after the publication of the first edition of his poems. Going, as was his wont, to spend a long Summer day by the sea-shore on Coney Island, in those years a place entirely uninhabited, he carried with him in the basket that contained his dinner, three volumes of 'Emerson's Essays,' which a friend had recommended to him. There, on that solitary beach fronting the sea, he that day, for the first time, read Emerson.</p><p>But he has been a reader of men and of things, and a student of America, much more than of books. Fond of cities, he has gone persistently into all their haunts and by-places, not as a modern missionary and reformer, but as a student and lover of men, finding beneath all forms of vice and degradation the same old delicious, yearning creatures, after all.</p><p>Lethargic during an interview, passive and receptive, an admirable listener, never in a hurry, with the air of one who has plenty of leisure, always in perfect repose, imple and direct in manners, a lover of plain, common people, 'meeter of savage and gentleman on equal terms,' temperate, chaste, sweet-breathed, tender and affectionate, of copious friendship, preferring always to meet as flesh and blood, and with a large, summery, motherly soul that shines in all his ways and looks, he is by no means the 'rough' people have been so willing to believe. Fastidious as a high caste Brahmin in his food and personal neatness and cleanliness, well dressed, with a gray, open throat, a deep, sympathetic voice, a kind, genial look, the impression he makes upon you is that of the best blood and breeding. He reminds one of the first men—the beginners; has a primitive, out-door look—not so much from being in the open air as from the texture and quality of his make—a look as of the earth, the sea, or the mountains, and 'is usually taken,' says a late champion of his cause, 'for some great mechanic, or stevedore, or seaman, or grand laborer of one kind or another.' His physiognomy presents very marked features—features of the true antique pattern, almost obsolete in modern faces—seen in the strong, square bridge of his nose, his high arching brows, and the absence of all bulging in his forehead, a face approximating in type to the statued Greek. He does not mean intellect merely, but life; and one feels that he must arrive at his results rather by sympathy and absorption than by hard intellectual processes; by the effluence of power rather than by direct and total application of it. In keeping with this, his poems do not have the character of carefully elaborated specimens—of gems cut and polished by the intellect, but are warm and vascular, like living organisms.</p><p>In the matter of health he is an exception to most known instances. He presents the rare phenomenon of a man giving himself to intellectual labor without suffering the slightest detriment to his physical powers; never knowing dyspepsia, nervousness, ennui, and an entire stranger to headache until his presence in the army hospitals, and his stopping too long consecutively after the battles of the Wilderness, with a collection of gangrened wounds, had inoculated his system with a malignant virus. And this robust bodily health, as we have said, is one key to his poems. The peculiar quality of them—a quality as of the open air, the woods, the shore, we believe to be more or less attributable to this source. The absence of all pettiness, dallying and sentimentalism, follows from a like cause.</p><p>We need not praise him for his patriotism, yet was there ever such a lover of country? He has trailed its entire geography through his poems, courteously saluted every city, great and small, celebrated every phase of its life, the habits of its people, their trades, tools, employments, etc.; has tallied in his poems its vast mass movements, and has not merely predicted, but unhesitatingly counted upon, a future greatness for it absolutely unparalleled in the history of the world.</p><p>Soon after the breaking out of the Rebellion, he was drawn to the seat of war to look after a wounded brother3—a captain in one of the New York regiments -and since that time has been engaged in field and hospital in nourishing the sick and wounded soldiers. Up to a very recent date he was still quietly but steadily occupied in the same ministrations among the few worst specimens that lingered in the hospitals about Washington.</p><p>His theory seems to have been that what the soldiers—many of them becoming worse, and even dying of sheer home-sickness—most needed, was a fresh, cheerful countenance, a strong, hopeful voice, and the atmosphere and presence of a loving and healthy friend. Hence he went among them purely in the spirit of love, distributing small gifts—sometimes of money, books, or papers, sometimes of fruits, delicacies, or special food—now reading aloud to a listening group, now soothing by his presence the worst, and, may be, last moments of some poor sufferer. Many soldiers can be found who aver that he saved their lives out and out. His mere presence was tonic and invigorating.</p><p>The book called 'Drum Taps,' which is the result of the poet's experience in the army and in the hospitals, and to which we propose to devote the remainder of this article, is a little volume of less than a hundred pages, full of warlike passion, singularly blended with as much sadness, perhaps, as was ever printed in a like space.</p><p>Those who know Walt Whitman will not be surprised at his calmness and good nature under the treatment awarded to his previous book, and that he should still display the same confidence in himself, and determination to 'fight it out on that line' that he evinced at first.</p><p>I am more resolute because all have denied me that I could ever have been had all <br>accepted me; I heed not, and have never heeded, either experience, cautions, majorities, <br>nor ridicule.</p><p>Yet, on the whole, the sadness and solemnity of 'Drum Taps' contrasts strongly with the flushed, exultant, arrogant, fore-noon spirit of 'Leaves of Grass.' Here the thought is of death and suffering, and of the desolation of hearts.</p><p>Though his themes are mostly suggested by our recent war, yet it is evidently not the purpose of the poet to give descriptions of battles and of great campaigns, or to celebrate great leaders and brilliant achievements; but rather to give the human aspects of anguish that follow in the train of war. He has looked deeper into the matter than the critics are willing to believe. He perhaps feels that the permanent condition of modern society is that of peace; that war, as a business, as a means of growth, has served its time, and that, notwithstanding the vast difference between ancient and modern warfare, both in the spirit and in the means, Homer's pictures are essentially true yet, and no additions to them can be made. War can never be to us what it was to Greece, Rome, and, indeed, to the nations of all ages down to the present; never the main fact—the paramount condition, tyrannizing over all the affairs of national and individual life; but only an episode, a passing interruption; and the poet who in our day would be as true to his nation and times as Homer was to his, must treat of it from the standpoint of peace and progress, and even benevolence. Vast armies rise up in a night and disappear in a day—half a million of men, inured to battle and to blood, go back to the avocations of peace without a moment's confusion or delay—indicating clearly the tendency that prevails.</p><p>Also, in obedience to the true democratic spirit, which is the spirit of the times, the attention of the poet is not drawn to the army as a unit—as a tremendous power wielded by a single will, but to the private soldier, the man in the ranks, from the farm, the shop, the mill, the mine, still a citizen engaged in the sacred warfare of peace. Always and always the individual, this is the modern doctrine, as opposed to slavery and caste and the results of the feudal world.</p><p>Hence those of the poet's friends who expected to find in this little volume all the 'pomp and circumstance of glorious war' have been disappointed. Apostrophizing the genius of America, he says:</p><p>No poem proud I chanting bring to thee—nor mastery's rapturous verse;<br>But a little book containing night's darkness and blood-dripping wounds,<br>And psalms of the dead.</p><p>His aim does not permit of the slightest expression of partisan or sectional feeling, or any exultation over a fallen foe. Under the head of 'Reconciliation' are these lines:</p><p>Word over all, beautiful as the sky:<br>Beautiful that war, and all its deeds of carnage, must in time be utterly lost;<br>That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly, softly wash again, and ever <br>again, this soil'd world;<br>For my enemy is dead—a man divine as myself is dead;<br>I look where he lies, white-faced and still, in the coffin—I draw near;<br>I bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin.</p><p>The following lines express with great vividness and force the feeling in which all true patriots shared during the second year of the war:</p><p>Year that trembled and reel'd beneath me!<br>Your Summer wind was warm enough—yet the air I breathed froze me;<br>A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me;<br>Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself;<br>Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?<br>And sullen hymns of defeat?</p><p>The poem on page 71 is so full of an overmastering pathos; and displays so well the poet's peculiar method and spirit, that we give it entire:</p><p>Pensive, on her dead gazing, I heard the Mother of All,<br>Desperate, on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battle-fields gazing;<br>As she call’d to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk’d:<br>Absorb them well, O my earth, she cried—I charge you, lose not my sons! lose not an <br>atom;</p><p>And you streams, absorb them well, taking their dear blood;<br>And you local spots, and you airs that swim above lightly,<br>And all you essences of soil and growth—and you, my rivers’ depths;<br>And you, mountain sides—and the woods where my dear children’s blood, trickling, <br>redden’d;</p><p>And you trees, down in your roots, to bequeath to all future trees,<br>My dead absorb—my young men’s beautiful bodies absorb—and their precious, precious, <br>precious blood;</p><p>Which holding in trust for me, faithfully back again give me, many a year hence,<br>In unseen essence and odor of surface and grass, centuries hence;<br>In blowing airs from the fields, back again give me my darlings—give my immortal <br>heroes;</p><p>Exhale me them centuries hence—breathe me their breath—let not an atom be lost;<br>O years and graves! O air and soil! O my dead, an aroma sweet!<br>Exhale them perennial, sweet death, years, centuries hence.</p><p>Or again in this:</p><p>Look down, fair moon, and bathe this scene;<br>Pour softly down night's nimbus floods, on faces ghastly, swollen, purple;<br>On the dead, on their backs, with their arms toss'd wide,<br>Pour down your unstinted nimbus, sacred moon.</p><p>The following exquisite stanza illustrates the poet's power to give a human interest to inanimate objects, and his biblical largeness and freedom in the use of metaphors:</p><p>Bathed in war's perfume—delicate flag!<br>O to hear you call the sailors and the soldiers! flag like a beautiful woman!<br>O to hear the tramp, tramp, of a million answering men! O the ships they arm with <br>joy!</p><p>O to see you leap and beckon from the tall masts of ships!<br>O to see you peering down on the sailors on the decks!<br>Flag like the eyes of women.</p><p>We invite the reader's careful consideration of one more piece, in which the poet's subtle art and large range of sympathies are perhaps best seen—the poem commemorating the death of Lincoln, beginning, 'When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed.' This poem must not be dismissed with a single perusal—a caution, indeed, which may well be observed in reference to the whole book. For, let it be understood, we are dealing with one of the most tyrannical and exacting of bards—one who steadfastly refuses to be read in any but his own spirit. It is only after repeated readings and turning to him again and again, that the atmosphere he breathes is reached. 'You must Summer and Winter with people to know them,' says an old proverb, which is especially true of this poet. The piece referred to is like intricate and involved music, with subtle, far-reaching harmonies. By that curious indirect method which is always the method of nature, the poet makes no reference to the mere facts of Lincoln's death—neither describes it, or laments it, or dwells upon its unprovoked atrocity, or its political aspects, but quite beyond the possibilities of the art of the ordinary versifier, he seizes upon three beautiful facts of nature which he weaves into a wreath for the dead President's tomb. The central thought is of death, but around this he curiously twines, first the early blooming lilacs which the poet may have plucked the day the dark shadow came; next the song of the hermit thrush, the most sweet and solemn of all our songsters, heard at twilight in the dusky cedars; and with these the evening star, which, as many may remember, night after night in the early part of that eventful Spring, hung low in the west with unusual lustre and brightness. These are the premises whence he starts his solemn chant.</p><p>The poem may disappoint on the first perusal. The treatment of the subject is so unusual—so unlike the direct and prosy style to which our ears have been educated—that it seems to want method and purpose. It eludes one; it hovers and hovers and will not be seized by the mind, though the soul feels it. But it presently appears that this is precisely the end contemplated by the poet. He would give as far as possible the analogy of music, knowing that in that exalted condition of the sentiments at the presence of death in a manner so overwhelming, the mere facts or statistics of the matter are lost sight of, and that it is not a narrative of the great man's death, done into rhyme, however faultless, or an eulogy upon his character, however just and discriminating, that offers an opportunity for the display of the highest poetic art, or that would be the most fitting performance on an occasion so august and solemn. Hence the piece has little or none of the character of the usual productions on such occasions. It is dramatic, yet there is no procession of events or development of plot, but a constant interplay—a turning and re-turning of images and sentiments, so that the section in which is narrated how the great shadow fell upon the land occurs far along in the piece. It is a poem that may be slow in making admirers, yet it is well worth the careful study of every student of literature.</p><p>Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,<br>Through day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land,<br>With the pomp of the inloop’d flags, with the cities draped in black,<br>With the show of the States themselves, as of crape-veil’d women, standing,<br>With processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night,<br>With the countless torches lit—with the silent sea of faces, and the unbared heads,<br>With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,<br>With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn;<br>With all the mournful voices of the dirges, pour’d around the coffin,<br>The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs—Where amid these you journey,<br>With the tolling, tolling bells’ perpetual clang;<br>Here! coffin that slowly passes,<br>I give you my sprig of lilac.</p><p>(Nor for you, for one, alone;<br>Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring:<br>For fresh as the morning—thus would I carol a song for you, O sane and sacred death.</p><p>All over bouquets of roses,<br>O death! I cover you over with roses and early lilies;<br>But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,<br>Copious, I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes;<br>With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,<br>For you, and the coffins all of you, O death.)</p><br><p>O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?<br>And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?<br>And what shall my perfume be, for the grave of him I love?</p><p>Sea-winds, blown from east and west,<br>Blown from the eastern sea, and blown from the western sea, till there on the prairies <br>meeting:<br>These, and with these, and the breath of my chant,<br>I perfume the grave of him I love.</p><p>O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?<br>And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,<br>To adorn the burial-house of him I love?</p><p>Pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes,<br>With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright,<br>With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expand-<br>ing the air;</p><p>With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees pro-<br>lific;</p><p>In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and <br>there;</p><p>With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows;<br>And the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,<br>And all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning.</p><p>The poem reaches, perhaps, its height in the matchless invocation to Death:</p><p>Come, lovely and soothing Death,<br>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,<br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>Sooner or later, delicate Death.</p><p>Prais’d be the fathomless universe,<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious;<br>And for love, sweet love—But praise! O praise and praise<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death,</p><p>Dark Mother, always gliding near, with soft feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee—I glorify thee above all;<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.</p><p>Approach, strong Deliveress!When it is so—when thou hast taken them, I joyously sing the dead,Lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee,Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death.</p><p>From me to thee glad serenades,<br>Dances for thee I propose, saluting thee—dornments and feastings for thee;<br>And the sights of the open landscape, and the high-spread sky, are fitting,<br>And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.</p><p>The night, in silence, under many a star;<br>The ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave, whose voice I know;<br>And the soul turning to thee, O vast and well-veil’d Death,<br>And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.</p><p>The gravity and seriousness of this book and its primitive untaught ways are entirely new in modern literature. With all our profuse sentimentalism, there is no deep human solemnity—the solemnity of a strong, earnest affectionate, unconventional man—in our literature. There are pathos and tears and weeds of mourning; but we would indicate an attitude or habit of the soul which is not expressed by melancholy—which is no sudden burst, or fit, or spasm—which is not inconsistent with cheerfulness and good nature, but which is always coupled with these—a state or condition induced by large perceptions, faith, and deep human sympathies. It may be further characterized as impatient of trifles and dallyings, tires even of wit and smartness, dislikes garrulity and fiction and all play upon words, and is but one remove from silence itself. The plainness and simplicity of the biblical writers afford the best example.</p><p>Contemplation, without love or sympathy, of the foibles, follies, and fashions of men and women and of their weaknesses and oddities begets the punning, scoffing, caricaturing habit we deprecate; contemplation of the laws and movements of society, the shows and processes of nature and issues of life and death, begets the rugged faith and sweet solemnity we would describe in 'Drum Taps.'</p><p>The reader perceives that the quality of these poems is not in any word, or epithet, or metaphor, or verbal and labial felicity whatever; but in the several atmospheres they breathe and exhale. The poet does not aim to load his pages with sweets—he makes no bouquets, distils no perfumes—whatever flower-scents there are, are lost in a smell as of the earth, the shore, the woods. Fine writing, with him, goes for naught. He seeks neither to please nor startle, nor even convince any more than nature does; and beauty follows, if at all, never as the aim, always as the result. There are none of the generally sought for, and, when found, much applauded, delicate fancies or poetical themes—but a large and loving absorption of whatever the earth holds. And this leads us to our final remark upon this subject, in making which we mean discredit to none.</p><p>It seems to us that Walt Whitman possesses almost in excess, a quality in which every current poet is lacking. We mean the faculty of being in entire sympathy with nature, and the objects and shows of nature, and of rude, abysmal man; and appalling directness of utterance therefrom, without any intermediate agency or modification.</p><p>The influence of books and works of art upon an author may be seen in all respectable writers. If knowledge alone made literature, or culture genius, there would be no dearth of these things among the moderns. But we feel bound to say that there is something higher and deeper than the influence or perusal of any or all books, or all other productions of genius—a quality of information which the masters can never impart, and which all the libraries do not hold. This is the absorption by an author, previous to becoming so, of the spirit of nature, through the visible objects of the universe, and his affiliation with them subjectively and objectively. The calm, all-permitting, wordless spirit of nature yet so eloquent to him who hath ears to hear! The sunrise, the heaving sea, the woods and mountains, the storm and the whistling winds, the gentle Summer day, the Winter sights and sounds, the night and the high dome of stars—to have really perused these, especially from childhood onward, till what there is in them so impossible to define finds its full mate and echo in the mind—his only is the lore which breathes the breath of life into all the rest. Without it, literary productions may have the superb beauty of statues, but with it only can they have the beauty of life.</p><p>JOHN BURROUGHS.</p>
