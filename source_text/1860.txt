<p>From the Monthly Trade Gazette. (New York, 1856.)</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS. By Walt Whitman. A poem that deserves and will eventually obtain a higher niche in Fame’s temple, than all the '—s' ever written. There is a sturdy strength—a far-reaching grasp of Titanic thought, boldly, manfully, and appositely expressed—and a filibuster-like daring running, like a strong, vigorous river, through its diction, which impress the reader with the conviction that he is in the presence of a more than ordinary man. The poem is written without regard to metrical rules, which the author evidently looks upon as puerile—in which we think he is nearer right than wrong—but it bears in every line the stamp of rude but sterling genius. The mean manner in which it is put forth by its publishers, however, will seriously interfere with its chances of publicity. Had it been issued in a dress worthy of the matter, it could hardly fail of mounting, at a single step, to the topmost floor of Novelty’s platform, and instantly commanding the public eye. As it is, its success will be a work of time. We give a cordial greeting to Leaves of Grass, which we look upon as the most considerable poem that has yet appeared in our country.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS Boston: THAYER & ELDRIDGE. Year 85 of the States—1860-61. 1 vol., pp. 456.</p><p>Five years ago a new poet appeared, styling himself the representative of America, the mouthpiece of free institutions, the personification of all that men had waited for. His writings were neither poetry nor prose, but a curious medley, a mixture of quaint utterances and gross indecencies, a remarkable compound of fine thoughts and sentiment of the pot-house. It was not an easy task to winnow the chaff from the wheat, the tares came up in such heavy luxuriance that they stunted the chance kernels of the grain, and nothing but the most vigorous of threshing was adequate to the elimination of one pure thought. That first edition of the Leaves of Grass was the earliest appearance of Mr. WALT. WHITMAN as an author. For a debutant, he was sufficiently egotistic and assuming. He announced, with a degree of confidence which could only have been the natural result of unparalleled self-conceit, that his mission lay in the reformation of the public taste, that the American people were to be enlightened and civilized and cultivated up to the proper standard, by virtue of his superior endowments, and that, being 'a Kosmos,' and inclined to 'loafe' at his ease, and 'invite his soul,' he could afford to wait for the public's warm appreciation of his self-sacrifice, and to recline in a comfortable attitude until the world saw fit to come round to him. Two years after the publication of the first thin and unprepossessing volume of the Leaves, a larger edition appeared, and that again is followed by a third and still more pretentious book, the present issue from the Boston house of THAYER & ELDRIDGE.</p><p>Mr. WHITMAN has added to this volume a large collection of his writings which have never been given to the public. If possible, he is more reckless and vulgar than in his two former publications. He seems to delight in the contemplation of scenes that ordinary men do not love, or which they are content to regard as irremediable evils, about which it is needless to repine. Mr. WHITMAN sees nothing vulgar in that which is commonly regarded as the grossest obscenity; rejects the laws of conventionality so completely as to become repulsive; gloats over coarse images with the gusto of a RABELAIS,1 but lacks the genius or the grace of RABELAIS to vivify or adorn that which, when said at all, should be said as delicately as possible.</p><p>Yet it would be unjust to deny the evidences of remarkable power which are presented in this work. In his hearty human sympathy, his wonderful intensity, his fullness of epithet, the author shows that he is a man of strong passion, vigorous in thought and earnest in purpose. He is uncultured, rude, defiant and arrogant, but these are faults of his nature which have not been tempered by severe training. Occasionally, a gleam of the true poetic fire shines out of the mass of his rubbish, and there are tender and beautiful touches in the midst of his most objectionable and disagreeable writings. A rough diamond, much in need of cutting and grinding and polishing, he has great intrinsic worth, but the impurities which cling about him must keep him out of the refined company he desires to enter. To be an agent for the civilization of men, he must first himself become civilized. He can do no manner of good by throwing filth, even though a handful of pure gold be sometimes mingled with a cast from his moral cesspool.</p><p>Nearly two hundred poems, of all sizes and qualities, are contained in this edition. Two dozens of these are properly the Leaves of Grass, grouped under that title, and mainly published in former editions. Chants Democratic and Native American comprise twenty- one curious specimens of composition, which are neither metrical nor harmonious. Fifteen others are collected under the comprehensive heading of Enfans d'Adam, and are humanitary. Fifteen others are Messenger Leaves. Four hundred and fifty pages of these productions establish the industry of the writer; and the fact that a respectable house has undertaken their publication, illustrates a lively faith in the eagerness of the public for the reception of novelties.</p><p>Some of the finer passages in this intricate maze of incongruous materials occur in the first hundred pages. Take the following weird conceit:</p><p>A child said: What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands.<br>How could I answer the child? I do not know what <br>it is, any more than he.<br>…I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br>A scented gift and remembrancer, designedly dropped,<br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, <br>that we may see and remark, and say, Whose?<br>…Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the pro- <br>duced babe of the vegetation:<br>…And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair <br>of graves.</p><p>In 'Chants Democratic,' the poet discourses of strong wills, and mirrors the image of the reformer.</p><p>How beggarly appear poems, arguments, ora-<br>tions, before an electric deed!<br>How the floridness of the materials of cities shriv- <br>els before a man's or woman's look!<br>All waits, or goes by default, till a strong being ap-<br>pears;<br>A strong being is the proof of the race, and of the<br> ability of the universe;<br>When he or she appears, materials are overawed,<br>The dispute on the Soul stops,<br>The old customs and phrases are confronted, turned <br>back, or laid away.</p><p>Again, he studies faces, and draws sharply-lined portraits:</p><p>This face is a life-boat;<br>This is the face commanding and bearded; it asks <br>no odds of the rest;<br>This face is flavored fruit, ready for eating;<br>This face of a healthy, honest boy, is the programme <br>of all good.</p><p>Yet the tendency to fall into the vulgar, apparently ineradicable in Mr. WHITMAN'S composition, leads him to interlard with these such expressions as 'abject louse, asking leave to be'—'milk-nosed maggot, blessing what lets it wrig to its hole'—'dog's snout, sniffing for garbage.' He will be gross, and there is no help for it.</p><p>The egotism of the book is amusing. Mr. WHITMAN is not only 'a man-myself, typical before all,' but he is 'a man thirty-six years old in the year 79 of America, and is here anyhow'—but, being here, lies in libraries 'as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,' thereby evincing a hearty contempt for scholastic culture; but nevertheless avowing a stern determination to:</p><p>…make a song for these States,<br>…and a shrill song of curses on him who would <br>dissever the Union.</p><p>It is fair to presume that this 'song of curses,' should it ever come to be sung, will be 'shrill,' and loud, not to say foul and abusive. Mr. WHITMAN is master of the art.</p><p>A better passage is that in which he describes the effect of music upon himself:</p><p>The orchestra wrenches such ardors from me, I did <br>not know I possessed them,<br>It throbs me to gulps of the farthest down horror;<br>It sails me—I dab with bare feet—they are licked by <br>the indolent waves,<br>I am exposed, cut by bitter and poisoned hail,<br>Steeped amid honeyed morphine, my windpipe throttled <br>in fakes of death,<br>At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,<br>And that we call Being.</p><p>There is great power in this passage;—rude strength, unpolished but vigorous.</p><p>A lover of nature, he sees all natural things through a pleasant medium. Trees, birds, fish alike delight him; he loves:</p><p>The cheerful voice of the public road—the gay fresh <br>sentiment of the road.<p><p>He sees Deity in everything:</p><p>…finds letters from God dropped in the street— <br>and every one is signed by God's name.</p><p>He loves the stillness of night, and apostrophizes it with passionate vehemence;</p><p>Press close, bare-bosomed Night! Press close, <br>magnetic, nourishing Night!<br>Night of south winds! Night of the large, few stars!<br>Still, nodding Night! Mad, naked, Summer Night!</p><p>It is needless to multiply extracts from these extraordinary productions. We make room for one more passage—a description of the close of a sea-battle, which is strongly tinted;</p><p>Toward twelve at night, there, in the beams of the <br>moon, they surrendered to us.<br>Stretched and still lay the midnight;<br>Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the dark-<br> ness,<br>Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking—preparations <br>to pass to the one we had conquered—<br>The captain on the quarter-deck, coldly giving his <br>orders through a countenance white as a sheet;<br>Near by, the corpse of the child that served in the <br>cabin,<br>The dead face of an old salt, with long white hair and <br>carefully curled whiskers;<br>The flames, spite of all that could be done, flickering <br>aloft and below,<br>The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit <br>for duty—<br>Formless stacks of bodies, and bodies by themselves; <br>dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars—<br>Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the <br>soothe of waves,<br>Black and impassive guns, litter of powder parcels, <br>strong scent,<br>Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass <br>and fields by the shore, death-messages given in <br>charge to survivors,<br>The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of <br>his saw,<br>Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild <br>scream, and long, dull, tapering groan—<br>These so—these irretrievable.</p><p>We infer that this is not the last of Mr. WALT WHITMAN. In point of fact, he gravely tells us that he is 'around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless and can never be shaken away;' he sings 'from the irresistible impulses of me;' purposes to make 'the Poem of the New World;' and 'invites defiance to make himself superseded,' avowing his cheerful willingness to be 'trod under foot, if it might only be the soil of superior poems,'—from which latter confession it is clear that he regards himself as the fertilizing agent of American Poetry; perhaps all the better for fertilizing purposes that the rains and snows of a rough life have caused it to fester in a premature and unwholesome decay.</p><p>Leaves of Grass.</p><p>We announce a great Philosopher—perhaps a great Poet—in every way an original man. It is Walt Whitman. The proof of his greatness is in his book; and there is proof enough.</p><p>The intellectual attitude expressed in these Leaves of Grass, is grand with the grandeur of independent strength, and beautiful with the beauty of serene repose. It is the attitude of a proud, noble, vigorous life. A human heart is here in these pages—large, wild, comprehensive—beating with all throbs of passion—enjoying all of bliss—suffering all of sorrow that is possible to humanity. 'This is no book,' it says; 'whoever touches this, touches a man.' It is the electrical contact of a great nature.</p><p>—'No dainty dolce affettuoso I; <br>Bearded, sunburnt, gray-necked, forbidding, I have  <br>arrived, <br>To be wrestled with as I pass, for the solid prizes of the  <br>universe, <br>For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them. . . . <br>I, exultant, will now shake out carols stronger and  <br>haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon the  <br>earth. . . . <br>And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with  <br>reference to all days, <br>And I will not make a poem, nor the least part of a  <br>poem, but has reference to the Soul, <br>Because, having looked at the objects of the universe,  <br>I find there is no one, nor any particle of one, but  <br>has reference to the Soul. <br>I pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-washed  <br>babe, and am not contained between my hat and boots . . . <br>I exist as I am—that is enough, <br>If no other in the world be aware, I sit content, <br>And if each and all be aware, I sit content. . . . <br>I am the poet of the body, <br>And I am the poet of the soul. <br>The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains of  <br>hell are with me, <br>The first I graft and increase upon myself—the latter I  <br>translate into a new tongue. <br>I know perfectly well my own egotism. . . . <br>I am an acme of things accomplished, and I am an en- <br>closer of things to be.'</p><p>Such is the intellectual attitude of the Leaves of Grass; such the position and purpose of their author. To accept everything as liberally as Nature accepts everything; to rightly appreciate all laws and all things, each thing in its place; to realize, reflect, and reproduce the emotions of every heart and the experiences of every person; to recognize and assert the universal harmony of creation; to know the beautiful union of Body and Soul in the individual, sublime in the present, and with a sublime destiny for the future; to repose in the certainty of infinite development and progression; to assert the individual above all things, knowing that 'nothing endures but personal quality'; to express for all mankind what all mankind feel without the power of expressing; to live the comprehensive life of the Philosopher, of the Poet, broad and vigorous, all lives in one,—reaching up into heaven, reaching down into hell, stretching backward over all the Past to gather up its results, throbbing with all the vital activity of the Present, making the Future glorious with more than hope,—this is the aim and the mission of Walt Whitman, this the felicity of his life as expressed in his poems. No man could utter himself more fully and truly. No book exists anywhere more beautifully in earnest than this. To the intelligent, sympathetic mind, none can explain itself with keener accuracy.</p><p>—'I will make the poems of materials, for I think  <br>they are to be the most spiritual poems, <br>And I will make the poems of my body and of mor- <br>tality, <br>For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems  <br>of my Soul and of immortality. . . . <br>I will acknowledge contemporary lands, <br>I will trail the whole geography of the globe, and salute cour- <br>teously every city large and small; <br>And employments! I will put in my poems, that with  <br>you is heroism, upon land and sea. . . . <br>And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in  <br>me—For I am determined to tell you with coura- <br>geous clear voice, to prove you illustrious. . . . <br>Omnes! Omnes! <br>Let others ignore what they may, <br>I make the poem of evil also—I commemorate that  <br>part also, <br>I am myself just as much evil as good—And I say there  <br>is in fact no evil, <br>Or if there is, I say it is just as important to you, to  <br>the earth, or to me, as anything else. <br>I too, following many, and followed by many, inaugu- <br>rate a Religion—I too go to the wars, <br>I will effuse egotism, and show it underlying all—And  <br>I will be the bard of Personality; <br>And I will show of male and female that either is but  <br>the equal of the other, <br>And I will show that there is no imperfection in male  <br>or female, or in the earth, or in the present—and  <br>can be none in the future, <br>And I will show that whatever happens to anybody, it  <br>may be turned to beautiful results—And I will  <br>show that nothing can happen more beautiful  <br>than death; <br>And I will thread a thread through my poems that no  <br>one thing in the universe is inferior to another  <br>thing, <br>And that all the things of the universe are perfect  <br>miracles, each as profound as any. . . . . <br>These are the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands—they  <br>are not original with me, <br>If they are not yours as much as mine, they are  <br>nothing, or next to nothing.'. . . .</p><p>The leading idea in the philosophy of the Leaves of Grass is the idea of grandeur and supremacy in the Individual. It asserts that there is nothing more divine than the human soul, and impels to a knowledge of living motive behind each thing and every action. It will have the singer and not the psalm, the preacher and not the script he preaches. It will not ignore the Body, but asserts its beauty and the divine harmony of Body and Soul.</p><p>…'I believe in you, my Soul—the other I am must not abase itself to you, <br>And you must not be abased to the other. . . . . <br>Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of  <br>any man hearty and clean, <br>Not an inch, nor a particle of an inch, is vile, and none  <br>shall be less familiar than the rest… <br>I believe in the flesh and the appetites, <br>Seeing, hearing, and feeling are miracles, and each tag  <br>and part of me is a miracle.—</p><p>It finds all things embraced and comprehended in the individual, to whom indeed the universe belongs and who belongs to the universe. It recognizes the common brotherhood of mankind, and the same human nature repeated in every person. Its aspiration is for a noble race of human creatures, healthy and beautiful, living delightfully, in sympathy with Nature, their perfect lives in a perfect world.</p><p>Perhaps the scope and significance of Walt Whitman's poetry may be more clearly indicated by contrasting its character with that of the poetry ordinarily accepted and popular at the present time. The latter is rhymed and measured. It is sometimes powerful with passion and sometimes stately with thought. It is generally sweet and graceful—expressing mild and monotonous sentiments in a thousand respectable ways. It is gay for a feast and sorry for a funeral. It is sweet as to Spring-time, and thoughtful as to sober Autumn days. It rhymes 'kisses' with 'blisses,' and expresses its writer's willingness to partake of the same. It mourns persistently for dead infants, for those who are snatched away in beauty's bloom, and for blighted blossoms generally. It has an amatory tendency, of a sentimental description, and wastes a good deal of miscellaneous sweetness. It presents its author as one who desires burial under a sweet- apple tree, and will not have a decent graveyard on any terms; it affects to ignore and despise the human body; it dwells fondly upon the sublime nature and destiny of the soul; and passing smoothly over all that is significant in this actual present life, it hints lugubriously at another and a better world. On the other hand these poems of Walt Whitman concern themselves alike with the largest and with the pettiest topics. They are free as the wandering wind that sweeps over great oceans and inland seas, over the continents of the world, over mountains, forests, rivers, plains, and cities; free as the sunshine are they, and like the sunshine ardent and fierce. Nothing in the creation is too sacred or too distant for the lightning glance of their aspiration; nothing that in any way concerns the souls and the bodies of the human race is too trivial for their comprehension. Everywhere they evince the philosophic mind, deeply seeking, reasoning, feeling its way toward a clear knowledge of the system of the universe.</p><p>On my way a moment I pause, <br>Here for you! And here for America! <br>Still the Present I raise aloft—Still the Future of The  <br>States I harbinge, glad and sublime, <br>And for the Past I pronounce what the air holds of the red  <br>aborigines. . . . . <br>Stop this day and night with me, and you shall pos-  <br>sess the origin of all poems; <br>You shall possess the good of the earth and sun—there  <br>are millions of suns left; <br>You shall no longer take things at second or third  <br>hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor  <br>feed on the spectres in books. . . . . <br>And I know that the hand of God is the promise of  <br>my own, <br>And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my  <br>own, <br>And that all the men ever born are also my brothers,  <br>and the women my sisters and lovers, <br>And that a kelson of the creation is love. . . . <br>I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-  <br>work of the stars, <br>And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand,  <br>and the egg of the wren, <br>And the tree-toad is a chef-d'œuvre for the highest, <br>And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven, <br>And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all  <br>machinery, <br>And the cow crunching with depressed head surpasses  <br>any statue, <br>And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions  <br>of infidels, <br>And I could come every afternoon of my life to look  <br>at the farmer's girl boiling her iron tea-kettle  <br>and baking short-cake.'</p><p>In this liberal scope of vision and purpose are indicated the insight and the earnestness characteristic of a poetic nature. Other elements of that poetic nature are evident in the vigor of imagination and splendor of imagery which make certain of these poems so truly remarkable. In the 'Salut au Monde'; in the poem called 'A Word Out of the Sea'—which, under the title of 'A Child's Reminiscence,' was printed in this paper last December; in the poem of 'Brooklyn Ferry'; in that of 'Sleep Chasings,' and that of 'Burial';—in these, and in others, such qualities largely and beautifully appear.</p><p>Some reflections may properly be submitted here, relative to the form in which Walt Whitman's poems are embodied and expressed. It is a form so rough and rugged—so careless, variable, and peculiar—that perhaps it is very natural the poetry should sometimes degenerate into prose. Something is to be said, however, in defence of this system of versification. It is at least original. The theory would seem to be, as Walt has variously indicated, that always the thought or the passion of the poet should determine itself in natural, congenial expression. It is assumed in this theory, and indeed it is very true, that much of the verse ordinarily written, is written without a sincere motive, and has therefore neither power nor value. It is further assumed that the styles of versification generally accredited and employed are inadequate to the utterance of earnest thought and feeling. Consequently, Walt Whitman, who presents himself as the Poet of the American Republic in the Present Age, who is actuated by a sincere motive, and has earnest thought and feeling to express, refuses to confine and cripple himself within the laws of what to him is inefficient art. Reverencing the spirit of poetry above the form, he submits that the one shall determine the other. That his volume is poetic in spirit cannot rationally be denied; and, whatever the eccentricities of its form, no critical reader can fail to perceive that the expression seems always the suitable and natural result of the thought. It is indeed tame and prosy in the conveyance of any commonplace idea or feeling, but it rises and melts into sweet and thrilling music whenever impelled by the beautiful impulse of a grand thought or emotion.</p><p>A fine example of this felicity of style occurs in the following beautiful passage, which also delightfully illustrates the poet's ardent and profound love of Nature:</p><p>'I am He that walks with the tender and growing Night, <br>I call to the earth and sea, half-held by the Night. <br>Press close, bare-bosomed Night! Press close, magnetic,  <br>nourishing Night! <br>Night of south winds! Night of the large few stars! <br>Still, nodding night! Mad, naked, summer night. <br>Smile, O voluptuous, cool-breathed Earth! <br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees! <br>Earth of departed sunset! Earth of the mountains, mis- <br>ty-topt! <br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon, just tinged with  <br>blue! <br>Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the  <br>river! <br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and clear- <br>er for my sake! <br>Far-swooping elbowed Earth! Rich, apple-blossomed  <br>Earth! <br>Smile, for YOUR LOVER comes! . . . . <br>I hear you whispering there, O stars of heaven, <br>O suns! O grass of graves! O perpetual transfers and  <br>promotions! <br>If you do not say anything, how can I say anything? <br>Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest, <br>Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight. <br>Toss, sparkles of day and dusk! toss on the black  <br>stems that decay in the muck! <br>Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.'</p><p>Another fine example is found in the following bit of description, which has all that simplicity can give of power, pathos, and music:</p><p>'Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf—posh and ice  <br>in the river, half-frozen mud in the streets, a gray  <br>discouraged sky overhead, the short last daylight  <br>of Twelfth Month, <br>A hearse and stages—other vehicles give place—the  <br>funeral of an old Broadway stage-driver, the cor- <br>tege mostly drivers. <br>Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-  <br>bell, the gate is passed, the new-dug grave is halt- <br>ed at, the living alight, the hearse uncloses, <br>The coffin is passed out, lowered and settled, the whip  <br>is laid on the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovelled  <br>in, <br>The mound above is flatted with the spades—silence, <br>A minute, no one moves or speaks—it is done, <br>He is decently put away—is there anything more? <br>He was a good fellow, free-mouthed, quick-tempered,  <br>not bad-looking, able to take his own part, witty,  <br>sensitive to a slight, ready with life or death for a  <br>friend, fond of women, gambled, ate hearty, drank  <br>hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew  <br>low-spirited toward the last, sickened, was helped  <br>by a contribution, died, aged forty-one years—and  <br>that was his funeral.</p><p>Of the defects in this book something also may properly be said. They are not trivial and they are not few. It is the law of a great nature to err greatly as well as to be greatly wise. Walt Whitman has exemplified that law. There are, as it seems to us, defects alike in his philosophy, art, taste, and style. It is fair to say there is much in his book that, like the peace of God, passeth all understanding, and that it does not lack passages which should never have been published at all. We may have occasion to refer to this book again, and to explain ourselves more fully in these regards. Meantime we submit, as appropriate in this connection, the following critical remarks from the North American Review:</p><p>'For the purpose of showing that he is above every conventionalism, Mr. Whitman puts into the book one or two lines which he would not address to a woman nor to a company of men. There is not anything, perhaps, which modern usage would stamp as more indelicate than are some passages in Homer. There is not a word in it meant to attract readers by its grossness, as there is in half the literature of the last century, which holds its place unchallenged on the tables of our drawing-rooms. For all that, it is a pity that a book where everything else is natural, should go out of the way to avoid the suspicion of being prudish.'</p><p>We should not conclude our notice of the Leaves of Grass without expressing our very great delight at the sumptuous elegance of the style in which Messrs. Thayer & Eldridge have published Walt Whitman's poetry. The volume presents one of the richest specimens of taste and skill in book-making, that has ever been afforded to the public by either an English or an American publisher.</p><p>Walt Whitman's new volume of poems, which he very quaintly calls 'Leaves of Grass' has come to hand. We have looked for it with more than ordinary interest, as men look for good tidings from a far country. For this man, we know, has a message, no matter how uncouth the form of it, to deliver to us, and to this generation. An authentic message!—which he has not learned in any school, at second hand, or gathered from books—or torn from parchment records, long since dead in monastic graves—but alive with God and the great fiery heart of the universe to-day, full of wild eloquence, and of all manner of intellectual and spiritual magnetisms.</p><p>It is not some seven, or eight, or more years ago, since this author—this Manhattan poet, who gives us so many antique and modern thoughts, so many new, strange, and startling images, and things suggestive of an imagery, which has no material archetype—cast his first grass leaves upon the waters, hoping as the prophecy declares of all vital things, that he should find them again—and that the world should find them—after many days. We, for one, carefully reading them at the time, had no manner of doubt nor shadow of a misgiving that such in their case, would be the issue. And here, after so long a lapse of time,—hundreds and thousands of highly bepraised books, in the mean while, having passed through the fires to Molech,1 and having been there consumed in the Gehenna Hell which is the just doom-place of rubbish—hundreds and thousands more still following them day by day, and will still continue to follow them until men cease to be fools—here we say is this book of Grass Leaves as fresh as ever, as redolent as ever of May flowers, and meadow bloom, and the aroma of woods and prairies.</p><p>We find many things new and old in this book; the old, welcome as the familiar faces of the old Gods to the first lovers and worshipers of the Gods—the new, bright with a radiance which is all their own, and welcome also for their surpassing beauty, and the new life which they bring. For these poems of Walt Whitman are no silly word-catching—no mere musical claptrap done into dainty feet with measured and mathematical precision—but they are the very life of the man, fragments both of his body and soul, with a genuine creative power in them big enough to create a soul under the ribs of death himself. The strongest man may refresh himself at the fountains of this shaggy aboriginal giant—who sits on the threshold of nature's arcane—his hands full of sunbeams; his mouth musical with so many sweet laughters, his whole face illuminated with the wise and beneficent mirth of the arcane Gods.</p><p>And if any one be inclined to call this rhapsody, let him prove his right to speak by producing his letters of competency. To all cavillers, questioners, and doubters, to all flippant young gentlemen of the French school, who do the brilliant for Bohemian clubs and Bohemian newspapers, to all drawing-room Fire-flies, and Will-o'-the-Wisps in general. who have so much to say and say nothing, we will offer them this admonishment: Hold your peace. This man is not for you, nor such as you. He speaks to men, not to lumbering journeymen, nor conceited apes, nor to anything of the breed of these. But if a brave, truthful reader, who is not afraid of hearing much that is too Hebraic to be polite, which any vulgar mind can make vulgar, and obscene ever, but which from the author's stand-point is by no means vulgar, but as sacred as the soul itself—if, we say, he be not afraid of such sentence as these, but will bear with them, and get their value out of them, whatever it may prove to be to him, for the sake of other and infinitely better, purer, wiser matters which he will assuredly find in these poems, we can commend and authorize him to address himself straightway to the work.</p><p>For the first time in American history a native poet sings to us of America. Your Longfellows, and Lowells, and Whittier—your male-men writers of all sorts, and your female-women writers of all sorts, may, if they please, and as they please, ignore America and its grand people and institutions, the struggles, battles, and conquests, the hopes, and loves, and hates, and all the fiery passions of the people; may write themselves unbelievers in the destiny of American civilization, atheists to their country, and go along to their lives' end, singing their dead songs about dead Europe, and its stupid monks and priests, its chivalry, and its thing a-my-bobs called kings—but not so this new comer, and great believer, this devout and prophetic son of America, born of the people of the soil. For him, to-day, is as great as any yesterday; as full, too, of romance and poetry; for he brings with him the eyes to see and the ears to hear, and the words to speak all the things which he thinketh. God has so gifted this new man, and has so educated him with faith in the present and the actual, in the future and the inevitable.</p><p>He sees nothing mean and low, nothing common any where around him. He is entranced by the miracle of existence, and wonder worlds open beneath him and around him wherever he walks, whatever he touches. All material things are suspended upon a scaffolding of impalpable thought—a living scaffolding of thought which, indeed, is the only reality; the material, being a phantasm which it projects, and to which it gives shape and form, motive and activity. This orientalism of vision, however, so far from being offensive, or even obtrusive, is the great underlying charm of the book, and its chief fascination, by which he holds the right reader with a magnetism as strong as the Poles. he is the most oriental and the most American of Americans. A strong, practical common sense runs through all his sentences; and he every where calls things by their right names, and uses no rosewater. You shall laugh and cry with him—but no man can laugh at him—even in his bluntest, rudest and most informal speech. We can see that whatsoever appertains to the honor, interest, learning, literature, culture, manners, laws and government of America, is very dear to him; dearer than all the world beside; and we love him for his love of this great and magnificent land. Legislators and literats, and office-seekers, and brilliant beer-drinkers, and grog drinkers, and the mob who hate law and government, may forget that they are Americans—may defame and traduce their country, sell its honor for a mess of pottage or try to make it a French stew by inoculating us with French notions, French books and French morals and habits—but not so, Whitman! True as the needle to the North is he true to his country, to the brave mother language, and to the American people.</p><p>We are well aware, and so doubtless is he that from the very structure and form of his verse he is more open to parody and burlesque than any living writer. Smart young gentle men of the ginger-beer sort, have tried their hands with immense success at this work—hitting us and the form, and, as usual, missing the spirit, the genius, the fine aroma of thought which breathe through the original. We are not disposed to give unqualified praise to Mr. Whitman, and we honestly think that he has written many things which, considering that women also and young girls go to make up the world, he might far better have left unwritten. We have no faith in Priapus, nor in the Phallic Symbolism. All that kind of worship and literature is long since dead for all good purposes—and needs no revival. And it seems sad to us—speaking from the common platform of the sexes—that so admirable a book should be marred by passages which put a taint upon its general purity.</p><p>People call Whitman an egotist—and he is no doubt an egotist of the most imperial sort. But he often speaks in his own name, when he represents the 'Cosmos,' and all nature and humanity. The reader must not always confound his personal pronouns with the poet's license of universality. He often speaks for the race when he appears to be speaking for himself. There can be no question, however, that Leaves of Grass are, on the whole, as genuine a piece of autobiography as that of Augustine, or Gibbon, or the Confessions of Rosseau.</p><p>And for the claims of this book to be called a book of poems, we will venture to say that there is more true poetry in it than would float any dozen modern volumes which the critics dignify with the name of poetry. We have already written so much that we can make no quotations here; but we look in vain out of these pages for any other voice which speaks for America—and speaks for her with equal power.</p><p>Look here, Walt Whitman, what made you write this book, these Leaves of Grass, full of good thoughts, bad thoughts, naughty thoughts, noble thoughts.</p><p>Ideas politic, impolitic, incomprehensible, insane, inexpressive, impure, invigorating, infuscatable, and infoliate.</p><p>Did you do it to make pennies, dimes, dollars, eagles, spondulics, rhino,</p><p>That Walt Whitman—human Walt, might row, ride, riot, regale, recuperate, refocilate—</p><p>At Hull, Hingham, Nahant, Newport, Rye, Niagara, Shirley, Long Island, Cohasset, Bergen Point, Cape May, or the Mountains called White?</p><p>Perhaps you did, but then again perhaps you didn’t, for the didn’t is resumptive in this world.</p><p>And you are anti-resumptive, reticular, responsive and restringent.</p><p>You’ve made a book, it can’t be rubbed out for it is a fact.</p><p>Rub out the stars, Declaration of Independence, habeas corpus, magna charta, squatter sovereignty, little Giant, old Abe.</p><p>Rub out sun, moon, clouds, streams, Board of Aldermen, Japanese Embassy, lapstreak, shell, canoe,</p><p>Rub out Boston Common, Battery, Girard College, Old Man of the Mountain, Franklin street, horse railroads, Baltimore Convention,</p><p>But rub out Leaves of Grass—456 pages, electro-typed, beautiful print, fine type, elegant binding, seemly, comely, white paper—published by Thayer & Eldridge,—it cannot be did.</p><p>The suspense is ended. The 'Distinctive American Poem'—the only one (God be thanked!) The country has yet produced—has appeared.</p><p>Lying before me as I write is an early copy of 'Leaves of Grass.' I have awaited its advent with some little anxiety, for I had been forced to extend to the later effusions of its author, a degree of admiration. I could not shut my eyes to their wild, rough beauty nor close my soul to the truths they expressed. Defiant of all precedent, scornful of all the conventionalisms of art, there was in them all a rude, grand sweep, as natural, and as musical too, as the breaking of the waves upon the shore, or the singing of the winds at night through the forest.</p><p>So when yesterday the looked-for volume reached me, you may be assured that it was eagerly opened. In the few hours that I have had the work, I have found time to read but little of it. That little, however, has sufficed! I lack inclination now for its further perusal.</p><p>After this frank confession, do not think that I purpose a review of the work. I have no such intention. I write simply to express my unqualified disgust with the portions I have read. Whether those portions are the best, or the worst, or an average, I do not know nor care to know. I opened the book at random, as one does a new book when leisure is wanting, and read what the pages before me held.</p><p>I make no quotations from those pages. I would offer neither to The Press, nor its readers, the offence of spreading before them even the daintiest lines those pages of filth contain. Until such time as the novels of de Kock find place upon parlor tables, and the obscene pictures, which boys in your city slily offer for sale upon the wharves, are admitted to albums, or grace drawing-room walls, quotations from Enfans d'Adam would be an offence against decency too gross to be tolerated.</p><p>I am not at all squeamish. Not easily shocked either. I adore the beautiful, and grow impassioned as I drink in the voluptuous in art or poesy. Amorous poetry, so far from being to me offensive, is delightful, and the soft, liquid lines of tender love, and the deep strains of a burning passion, seem to me alike fit hymns for man to offer up. But Walt Whitman's poems are not amorous; they are only beastly. They express far more truthfully the feelings of brute nature than the sentiments of human love.</p><p>Walt Whitman assumes to regard woman only as an instrument for the gratification of his desires, and the propagation of the species. To him all women are the same, with but this difference, the more sensual have the preference, as they promise greater indulgence. His exposition of his thoughts shows conclusively that with him the congress of the sexes is a purely animal affair, and with his ridiculous egotism he vaunts his prowess as a stock-breeder might that of the pick of his herd.</p><p>It is bad enough, I submit, for a person to be so utterly brutalized. There needs not the further degradation of publishing his brutality. A true man regards the intimate relations he may sustain toward the woman who holds his affections as something too holy to be lightly talked of, too sacred to be bruited abroad. To the true man, the congress of the sexes is a sacrament, a holy secret locked in the breasts of two persons, which it were gross profanation to expose to the gaze of any beside. To such an one, all women are not the same nor is capacity for beastly indulgence the distinguishing trait of the chosen one. But it is unnecessary for me to dilate upon this. All will feel what I might say in this connection.</p><p>Walt Whitman has had a narrow escape from being a great poet. He combines in him all the requisites but one; but that one is indispensable. He has strength, he has beauty, but he has no soul. Intellect, I grant, wide in its scope, and powerful in its grasp. Yet with all this, I doubt if, when the Judgment-Day comes, Walt Whitman's name will be called. He certainly has not enough soul to be saved. I hardly think he has enough to be damned.</p><p>Walt Whitman has done his work. He has shown to the world that one may have the form and presence of a man, may possess an intellect whose scope and power entitle him to high place among the gifted ones of earth, and yet in those finer qualities which most intimately connect man with higher intelligences, be utterly wanting, and at the poor level of 'the beasts that perish.'</p><p>He has done this, and the world has now no further need of him. It accepts the revolting lesson, as it must, but it does not need the teacher longer. If Walt has left within him any charity, will he not now rid the taught and disgusted world of himself? Not by poison, or the rope, or pistol, or by any of the common modes of suicide, because some full man, to whom life has become a grievous burden, may at a later day be compelled to choose between death by the same means and a hateful life, and with the pride of noble manhood turn shuddering to live on, rather than admit so much of oneness as would be implied by going to death as did Walt Whitman. But let him search the coast of his island home until he finds some cove where the waves are accustomed to cast up the carrion committed to them, and where their bloated bodies ride lazily upon the waters which humanity never disturbs, and casting himself therein find at last the companionship for which, in death as in life, he is best fitted.</p><p>Let him do this act of reparation, and the world may kindly extend to him the charity of forgetfulness—the highest boon it now can bestow.</p><p>In pursuance of our plan to give the patrons of the ILLUSTRATED NEWS illustrated information in regard to all the new sensations of the day, whether in politics, art or literature, we present here a finely-executed portrait of WALT WHITMAN, the new American poet, the recent publication of a superb edition of whose poems 'Leaves of Grass' is bringing him permanently before the American people as one of the most remarkable men of this day and generation.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN was born in Brooklyn, Long Island, May 31, 1818, and is yet a resident of the 'City of Churches.' He is a printer by trade, as many other men distinguished in the annals of this country have been; and, by the force of his own native genius, has risen from the case to become one of the great lights and leaders of literature—a poet whose broad and vigorous power and uncommon felicity of illustration is acknowledged wherever the English language is spoken. His first appearance before the public was in 1855, when he issued a small and unprepossessing edition of his 'Leaves of Grass,' previous to which, however, he had contributed some poems to the press, which attracted attention by their power and originality. On sending a copy of the first edition of his poems to Ralph Waldo Emerson, who is acknowledged to be the foremost man in modern literature, he received the following letter in reply:</p><p>CONCORD, Mass., July 21, 1855.</p><p>DEAR SIR:—I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of 'Leaves of Grass.' I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed. I am very happy in reading it, as great power makes us happy. It meets the demand I am always making of what seemed the sterile and stingy nature, as if too much handiwork, or too much lymph in the temperament, were making our western wits fat and mean.</p><p>I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things said incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.</p><p>I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere, for such a start. I rubbed my eyes a little to see if this sunbeam were no illusion; but the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.</p><p>I did not know, until I last night saw the book advertised in a newspaper, that I could trust the name as real and available for a post-office. I wish to see my benefactor, and have felt much like striking my tasks and visiting New York to pay you my respects.</p><p>R. W. EMERSON.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN.</p><p>This letter of the highest praise, from one of the greatest minds in the world, called the attention of many literary people to these new poems, and they were largely bought up. In 1856 he issued another and somewhat enlarged edition, which were speedily disposed of. An interim of four years has elapsed, and having had ample leisure in the meantime for composition of new pieces, he now comes before the public with a superb edition of his work, containing about twice as much matter as the first edition, the success of which has already been great, and must be enormous.</p><p>There is a great career in store for Walt Whitman, and we shall watch his future with interest. An interesting review of his work was given in the last number of the ILLUSTRATED NEWS.</p><p>The 'Leaves of Grass' is published by Thayer & Eldridge, of Boston, and the book—take it altogether—is, perhaps, the most magnificent specimen of typography ever issued by the American Press.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS By WALT WHITMAN. BOSTON: THAYER AND ELDRIDGE.</p><p>The people who have not yet heard of Walt Whitman are few indeed. This last enlarged collection of his poems makes a stout volume, to which the bold and tasteful publishers have given a dress altogether striking, unique and original. All sorts of things - hard and soft -have been said by the literary critics about this same Walt Whitman and his writings. One paper, in commenting upon another's indiscriminate praise of him, remarks that it is 'into this gentle garden of the Muses that that unclean cub of the wilderness, Walt Whitman, has been suffered to intrude, trampling with his vulgar and profane hoofs among the delicate flowers which bloom there,' &c.</p><p>Nobody who has read Whitman's poems, can question his originality. He betrays high culture, even when he seems almost swinishly to spurn it. We think that few writers of our day, if any, whether in prose or verse, have so seized hold of the spirit of things—no matter what, where found, or intertwisted with whatever associations—as this one before us. And the best proof of it is just that free habit of expression which all the literary poodles are happy to style 'barbaric.' It is time their snobbery was supplanted by strength of some sort even if it be barbaric. We have had soft flute-blowing long enough; now let us bear the jarring screech of a fife. Our poet they call nasty, because he scorns to be knavish; he has the right of it, beyond a question, calling a spade a spade, and a meat-axe a meat-axe; and in exercising his elephantine strength and motions, he doubtless takes a secret delight in the mere act of exercising them, and holding all napper-tandy forms and by-laws in scorn; he proudly refuses to so much as appease the prejudices of critics by respecting the commonly received statutes of the great Literary Republic.</p><p>This man's verse—wild, rapid, Ossianic,1 wailing, grand, humble, innocent, defiant, irregular, defective, overfull, and altogether inflexible as it is—forms, after all, the truest illustration, if not representative, of the real American Age that is, and is to be. He has searched all truth, all knowledge, all science. Even when his expression torments you, the great, surcharged soul that throbs and plays underneath, looks forth serious and awful, refusing to be satisfied with itself, unsettling all things, breaking up the heavens into new and sometimes terrific forms, and pointing down to abysmal deeps in human experience, to which even the most powerful sight of spirit has never penetrated. Above all other singers of songs—rude or rhyming—Whitman hints to you of your capacity; if you have not yet awakened to the possession of any, you cannot understand him, of course. Neither can you understand him wholly, at best; for his own writings prove that he does not, and never will entirely, understand himself. And this is the mystery that gives Life its deep meaning.</p><p>The whole body of these Poems—spiritually considered—is alive with power, throbbing and beating behind and between the lines. There is more here than mere oddity, and barbaric indifference to elegant forms of speech; there is a living soul—no matter whether its owner drove an omnibus once, or stands on State street and chaffers greedily every day for gold—and that soul insists on giving itself to its fellows, even if it has to rend the most sacred rules of speech to achieve its larger liberty. Carlyle did so, and triumphed; Whitman's way is as much his own, too. It is no way at all, to make up even literary judgment by examining the colors, and not the warp and woof. It is the texture of the stuff that tells, because it is that which is going to endure.</p><p>Thus much of the Poet Whitman; we leave our readers to examine his wonderful productions—so bizarre, so fine, so entirely out of and beyond all rule—and know for themselves, as they would know a familiar friend, the spirit that lives in them. The disjecta membra 2 of the man's speech we throw to the hungry critics, who are ever delighted to snap up such meaty morsels; of the soul that burns through—nay, burns up—all the mere words, consuming the verbiage as fire licks up dried grass, we are but too eager to speak as it deserves; and with that soul all other growing souls will hasten to make themselves acquainted. Whitman comes to us—perhaps not a discoverer, but certainly a grand interpreter. One-sided and all sided—intense and indifferent—lazy and lashed into fury-spouting words and pouring out streams of rubies and diamonds—he is nothing more than the very child of nature, to whom accidentally has been given the name, WALT WHITMAN.</p><p>[From the Albion, May 1860.]</p><p>Messrs. Thayer & Eldridge have published a third edition of Leaves of Grass, in which we recommend our reader endeavor to find the following passages:</p><p>1.<br>I happify myself.<br>I am considerable of a man.

But our attention is just now called to a little pamphlet-collection of notices of the previous editions of 'Leaves of Grass,' and by that we find that we have been forestalled in two instances. Had we known this we should have written otherwise; but as it is, we let our squib go. We admit that although there is no verse in Mr. Whitman's book, there is some poetry—a little—of an exquisite and peculiar cast, which flecks the surface of a very copious and strong expression of sympathy with and close observation of external nature. But the latter is not necessarily poetry, even when written by a poet of transcendant powers. Witness the description of the horse in Shakspeare's 'Venus and Adonis,' which is an enumeration of points better suited to Tattersall's books than to a work of fancy and imagination. As to these 'Leaves of Grass,' nine-tenths of them are covered with words that have no more meaning, coherency, or perceptible purpose than the columns in a spellingbook; while the indecency—an indecency not born of prurience, but of the absolute refusal to recognize such a distinction as decent and indecent—is monstrous beyond precedent, and were it not before our eyes, beyond belief. Yet for the one-tenth that we have excepted we shall keep the book, and read it, not without a strange interest in the man who could draw such a slender thread of truth and purity through such a confused mass of folly, feculence, and falsehood.</p><p>Messrs. Thayer & Eldridge have printed the book in very handsome style.</p><p>A NEW AMERICAN POEM.</p><p>It has been a favorite subject of complaint with English critics and reviewers, in treating of American Civilization, that in this country we have produced as yet no peculiar, distinctive literature of our own, and that all our efforts in polite letters have been but feeble imitations of English originals, lunar reflections, as it were, of that intellectual sun which, we are told, still rises for us over the Atlantic. Thus, they allege, we refer to Cooper as 'The American Scott,' Emerson is Carlyle and water (and very muddy water, in the present writer's humble judgment), the North American Review is a poor copy of the Edinburgh, and so forth. But especially do they reproach us with a lack of originality in the poetical form of composition. There is fancy and sweetness and music, they admit, in our poets, but we can point to no one great poem on which is stamped the impression of a new and mighty continent, which is fragrant with the fresh odours of the unpruned-forest, whose rhythm, mighty in its movement as the wind rushing over the limitless prairie, bears the reader along unresistingly—a poem, in short, full of the energy, the passion, the vim of large-veined, stout-breasted, hopeful, wide-awake, go-ahead Young America. But the reproach can be made no longer. We have an American poem. Several of them. Yes, sir. Also a great original representative mind. 'The hour and the man' have arrived, the man who knows what's o'clock and always comes up to time. The name of this wonderful poet is Walt Whitman, and his verdant volume of verse is called 'Leaves of Grass.'</p><p>Perhaps we are wrong in referring to these 'leaves' as verse. We used that term for want of a better one, and having in mind the definition of the master in the Bourgeois Gentilhomme—Tout-ce qui n'est point prose est vers, et tout-ce qui n'est point vers est prose. Worthy Monsieur Jourdain was astonished, as Moliére makes him confess, to discover that he had been speaking prose all his life without knowing it, but the master would have experienced a much greater degree of amazement, could he have seen his theory demolished by a poem like any one of these by Walt Whitman. Here is something which is neither prose nor verse, which writes itself out in long or short sentences, as the case may be, disdaining the shackles of rhyme or measure, and sounding to the ear alternately like the click of the instrument in the Telegraph office, the roar of Buttermilk Falls, the eloquence of the Razor-Strop man, the buzz of a wheat-machine, the braying of an ass, the cries of 'the boys' running to a big fire with No 40, the animated evening conversation in a Lager Bier Saloon, and a campaign speech in the House of Representatives.</p><p>Mr. Walt Whitman is to us, however, no 'new Nebuchadnezzar,' nor has the 'Leaves of Grass' been brought to our notice now for the first time. Five years ago we recollect to have seen the first edition of it, and to have made up our mind that if it did not proceed from a lunatic, it was designed as a solemn hoax upon the public. The extravagance of the style, the beastliness of the sentiments, the blatant blasphemy of the whole performance, its profanation of every tender and holy impulse, its frequent indecency of language, all suggested Bedlam. The bizarre appearance of the book also indicated a crazy origin. The page, about half the size of our own, was printed in type as large as that of a playbill, the presswork seemed to have been done with a sledgehammer, and the frontispiece was adorned with a full length portrait, in the finest steel engraving, of Walt Whitman, in which, without other garment than shirt and pantaloons, his sleeves rolled up and arms akimbo, he appeared to be doing his best to look like a rowdy and a vagabond, and with greater success, it must be admitted, than ordinarily falls to poor human endeavor.</p><p>After the lapse of a lustrum, not so long a time as was recommended by the Latin critic for keeping a poem before publication, the profane bestial rigmarole is again brought before the public, enlarged, altered and rendered, if possible, more disgusting and abominable than in its pristine shape. If the present edition had excited no more comment than the first, we should not have taken the trouble to refer to it. But it has been widely noticed and even applauded, an immense amount of advertising has been expended upon it by the publishers, and there is danger that it may find its way into respectable bookstores and even pure households, by reason of the attention it has received. To save the latter from moral contamination and the necessity of using disinfectants, we feel bound to say so much by way of caution as will enable them to learn the true character of the volume. Not that we would pollute our columns with quoting any of its vilest passages. It will suffice, we hope, to say that Walt Whitman glories in materialism of the most degraded kind, that the animal passions call forth his loftiest admiration, and that man as a brute, in his earthly relation to the beasts that perish, not in his kinship to immortal beings, is the object of that faculty which in the Walt Whitman organization takes the place of reverence. Not only is he without the means of discriminating between the pure and the impure, but the Chevalier Bayard is no more to him than a chicken cock, Tennyson is no higher in the scale of created things than a tadpole, and he can perceive no difference between Bacon and a Berkshire pig.</p><p>And yet all this is mixed up with constant references to the soul, of which he assumes to be an interpreter.

Walt Whitman is the poet of prizefighters, the minstrel of muscle; his is the song of sinews, the burthen of brawn, and he thinks naturally enough that the age and generation which could delight in the Mill of the Champions, must applaud the apotheosis of brute strength. Among the Heenan-ities of the day, his verse may find admirers, but with all the votaries of a pure literature, he must be greeted with a 'Procul, procul este profani!'</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS. Boston: Thayer & Eldridge. Year 85 of the States—(1860–61)</p><p>This is a new edition of the work of Walt Whitman, which some years ago created so great a sensation both in this country and abroad, and it seems now destined to renew the former effect. It is very much discussed and criticized, and is indeed a singular production. Distinguished by power of a certain sort, by bursts of originality, by occasional undoubted cleverness, it is also disfigured by the most disgusting beastiality we remember ever to have seen in print; a beastiality which is the most prominent feature of the book, which is utterly animal, and so marked that it not only gives tone to the work, but indicates the character of the writer. Vigorous, coarse, vulgar, indecent, powerful, like a great strong, filthy bull, delighting alike in his size and his strength, and his filth; full of egotism, rampant, but not insufferable, fully believing himself to be a representative man and poet of the American people; persuaded that he is the great poet whose advent the world is waiting for, and that his errand is to sing his own individuality, his own peculiarities, whether physical or spiritual, but particularly physical; his own idiosyncracies, whether little or great; his own characteristics, whether noble or mean; and all these not so much because they are his individualities and characteristics and idiosyncracries , as because he thinks they typify those of other Americans—this is Walt Whitman's character and notions, as they seems to be developed in his Leaves of Grass. The measure in which he writes is his own, and is often no measure at all, but a sort of alliteratives style, with a certain rough music in it; his style is outside of all rules, transgresses, grammar and rhetoric, it jumbles up slang and vulgarity with choice language, huddles together English and scraps of French and Latin and Spanish in the absurdest fashion, and yet at times has a certain terseness that is telling. The book is, in many respects abominable; in many respects the maddest folly and the merest balderdash that ever was written; but it unfortunately possesses these streaks of talent, these grains of originality, which will probably preserve the author from oblivion. We should advise nobody to read it unless he were curious in literary monstrosities, and had a stomach capable of digesting the coarsest stuff ever offered by caterers for the reading public, and yet those who are catholic enough to appreciate two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff, will not be uninterested in the volume.</p><p>I have read carefully, thoughtfully, admiringly, many of the poems of Walt Whitman, at first with astonishment mingled with distrust; but as I re-read and read again and fully grasped his thought, the simple grandeur of his expressed soul, filled mine with awe and reverence for the pages he had the genius to inspire; and I see him now the apostle of purity, the teacher of the most vital, and hence the most Divine truth. In his refusal to recognise such distractions as 'decent and indecent' in the human structure—though, in the opinion of another critic, this is 'monstrous beyond precedent'—I see the sweetest simplicity and child-like innocence. More than that, I see the purity of the heart maintained spite of all the strong impulses of youth, spite of the hush and whisper and taboo of an age of virtuous prostitution, until the equipoise of mature life, the wisdom gained by experience, informs his mind and dictates his words. In childhood there is no blush of shame at sight of a nude form, and the serene wisdom of maturity covers this innocence with a hale of glory, by recognising the divinity of humanity, and perceiving the unity of all the functions of the human body, and the inevitable tendency to harmonic adjustment and adaptation. As all of nature's forms are evolved from the same God-origin or substance, though there may be differences of rank, there can be no difference in essence; and those functions which have been deemed the most brutal and degrading, will be found to be first in rank when nature's hierarchy shall be established and observed. A true delicacy will neither emblason the individual act of communion abroad (as, sanctioned by custom, those who lay claim to the highest refinement do daily), nor blush to a crimson when the poet of sexual purity vindicates manhood and womanhood from the charge of infamy, degradation, and vice, on account of growth and development after the order of nature. Of course those who assert the doctrine of total depravity must find some part of the person too vile to think of, and will be shocked to hear another express unqualified admiration for the human body and the human soul.</p><p>MARY A.

[Review]</p><p>BY ADAH ISAACS MENKEN HEENAN.</p><p>Swimming against the current is hard and dangerous work.</p><p>Strong, firm, and iron bound must be the noble vessel; brave and fearless must be the hearts that stand at the helm. 'God and our right' must be the pass-word of those who lift their sails to stem the current.</p><p>Individuality of intellect and an affinity with God—not society—powerful energy, a potent buoyancy, and a strong volition can and will venture the task. Cowardice is the demonstration of weakness. Strength and valor must exert themselves in valorous actions. Courage is the true demonstration of strength. And whoever is gifted with that mental and moral god-power, to stand like a rock in the midst of a roaring storm, feels the mighty impulse to oppose the impetuous billows of the rushing current—dare the storm—stem the tide, will reach the goal, gain eternal life, for they are God's children of inspiration!</p><p>But few, oh! too few, possess these holy attributes, to bear them up against wind and wave. Therefore, the vast majority of mankind intrust themselves with so much ease and convenience to the current of popular sentiments, fashions, weak, driveling notions, idiotic principles: plying, now and then, a little with the useless rudder of their intellect, they swim lazily along with the current; flattering the ambition and passions of the influential and great men, worshiping the idols of the day, to suit prevalent notions, taking every advantage of the weak, and infirm, they swim down the current of life, and arrive quietly and conveniently into the harbor of Death.</p><p>Swimming against the current is hard and dangerous work! How few are the brave souls that are to-day stemming the tide! Seward, Jefferson Davis, Sumner, Lovejoy, Wendell Phillips, Beecher, Theodore Parker, Garrison, Walter Whitman, Mrs. Hatch, and perhaps some few more. There they stand, in the midst of inhumanity, few and far apart, like the islands of the ocean, fertile and fresh as the cases of the desert, 'their shoulders and upward higher than all the people,' as the mountains range and overtower the plains and valleys below.</p><p>There they stand with their spontaneous and generous impulses, the internal ear and eye of humanity, that sees and grasps instinctive eagerness at the faults and corruptions of men, things, religions, and institutions around them.</p><p>They have braved the current, for they hear the divine voice of inspiration calling, 'Whom shall I send to the rescue?' And they could not help responding, 'Here I am—send me!'</p><p>But alas! they swim against the current, and laborious and tiresome is the task. Many a foaming wave rushes at their heads, and renders them almost helpless for awhile; but they recover, and swim on, God bless them!</p><p>Sometimes overcome by the strong battle of the waves, a fainting soul pauses for rest; he looks down the stream, and sees thousands of pleasure-boats moving smoothly with the current, and rocking softly the rich, gay, happy, and successful passengers. He hesitates. 'Shall I join them? Shall I blot out God's voice that calls me?' he asks. No , he cannot resist that holy voice. Onward is his course—he must swim again.</p><p>Look at Walter Whitman, the American philosopher who is centuries ahead of his contemporaries, who, in smiling carelessness, analyzes the elements of which society is composed, compares them with the history of past events, and ascertains the results which the same causes always produced, and must produce. Thus [one line of newspaper text illegible]. He hears the Divine voice calling him to caution mankind against this or that evil, and wields his pen, exerts his energies, for the cause of liberty and humanity!</p><p>But he is too far ahead of his contemporaries; they cannot comprehend him yet; he swims against the stream and finds me company. The passengers, in their floating boats, call him a fanatic, a visionary, a demagogue, a good-natured fool, etc., etc. Still he heeds them not: his mental conviction will not permit him to heed them.</p><p>Thousands of philosophers, poets, senators, preachers of God, philanthropists, friends and saviors of liberty, women of inspiration, men of reform, have been drowned in the current of life, because they swam against the stream—died with the deep-seated pain in their breasts, poisoned with disappointment, insult, or ridicule, or starved to death by an ungrateful people—poor Edgar A. Poe, for example. But when in the next century their words and schemes will become understood, because circumstances will take that turn which they predicted, marble statutes will be erected over the remains of him whom they suffered to starve, because he swam against the current.</p><p>Suppose all men would yield to the current of the age? None would manfully uncover the rotten spots, expose the errors and prejudices entertained, and the evils practiced. Would not humanity soon be degraded into a reckless pleasure-party, skipping around, and approaching always nearer the yawning whirlpool, until finally the whole boat would rush in.</p><p>Yes! those men who have the valor and moral courage to swim against the current, are the noble and generous towers of humanity. Yet we ignore and contradict them; yet they are, nevertheless, the Messiahs of humanity. Mankind is obliged to them for new ideas, periodical regeneration, and the progress of civilization. They combat with the waves, and are frequently buried beneath them; but after centuries, they are rescued from the aqueous grave, and rise to perpetual glory!</p><p>If there is any truth in the above—and close observation of facts prove that there is—it is also morally certain that thus Israel will rise to perpetual glory! So the house of Jacob will be rescued from the grave, and a proud monument assigned us in the history of the world. So Judea will triumph, after darkness and ignorance will be utterly dispelled by the radiant sun of divine truth! For thus Israel has swam against the current for thirty centuries and more! Thus it has struggled and combated against the corruptions of all ages in history; Thus is Israel the savior, the Messiah of the nations!</p><p>Israel swam against the current when heathenism reigned supreme, when Grecian philosophy undermined the ancient superstructure of religion, when Epicure's doctrines demoralized Rome, and heathenism gave way before Christianity and the Islam. It swam against the current of popular religions in all periods of history; and does it yet, with the same energy and unabated vigor. Buried under waves of popular prejudices, it always resurrects again in youthful strength, valor, and glory of eternal life!</p><p>'Hail thee, Israel, who is like unto thee? a people saved by God, the shield of thy salvation and the sword of thy pride!'</p><p>Some weeks or months ago, we remarked upon a poem published in the Atlantic Monthly, from the pen of Walt Whitman—a nonsensical, whimsical scraggy performance, about as much like poetry as tearing off a rag, or paring one's corns. Recently the writer has appeared in a large volume, (published in the puritanical and transcendental city of Boston, by Thayer & Eldridge, who we hope are willing to stand the notoriety of it,) and a more scandalous volume we never saw. We had not intended to notice it, but certain of the soft heads, on the shoulders of men and women indiscriminately, have conceived that it is a pure book. In the last number of the New York Saturday Press, Mary A. Chilton gives her ideas of Walt Whitman's poetry generally, and especially of his smut; and to show the public how far into degradation certain new lights are ready to be led, we quote a portion of her letter, simply italicising such sentences as we wish to call special attention to:—</p><p>'In childhood there is no blush of shame at sight of a nude form, and the serene wisdom of maturity covers this innocence with a halo of glory, by recognizing the divinity of humanity, and perceiving the unity of all the functions of the human body, and the inevitable tendency to harmonic adjustment and adaptation. As all of nature's forms are evolved from the same God-origin or substance, though there may be difference of rank, there can be no difference in essence; and those functions which have been deemed the most brutal and degrading will be found the first in rank when nature's hierarchy shall be established and observed. A true delicacy will neither emblazon the individual act of communion abroad (as, sanctioned by custom, those who lay claim to the highest refinement do daily,) nor blush to a crimson when the poet of sexual purity vindicates manhood and womanhood from the charge of infamy, degradation, and vice, on account of growth and development after the order of nature. Of course those who assert the doctrine of total depravity must find some part of the person too vile to think of, and will be shocked to hear another express unqualified admiration for the human body and the human soul.'</p><p>A professedly obscene book carries with it its own condemnation among decent people, and finds its own market among the vicious and unclean. Besides, there are laws against its promulgation; and appeal can be made to them if it is openly exposed for sale, or advertised, or sold more secretly. This literature is not unfrequently stuck in one's face at steamboat landings by lousy scoundrels who peddle filth for a living, but one can always cry 'police' if he will, and stop it. Here, however, is a book with many respectable associations—respectable publishers—the author a writer for the Atlantic Monthly—'for sale everywhere' on respectable book-shelves—in very respectable type and binding—advertised in respectable papers—and yet it has page after page that no man could read aloud to a decent assembly without being hooted out of it, and that could not be published in the columns of a daily newspaper without disgusting and outraging a virtuous community. The dangers of the book lie in its claiming to be a respectable book—in its claiming to be a pure book, and in the fact that there are lecherous fools enough in the world to allow this claim, if not to maintain it. We are inclined to think that the author considers the book a pure one. It costs some charity to admit this, and a large allowance for eccentricity of mind and temperament; but, making the admission, we are at liberty to comment on that phase of infidelity of which it is the outgrowth.</p><p>Nothing is more notorious than the fact that when any individual claims to have some light superior to that revealed in the Bible, whether that light be the 'light of nature,' simply, or the light of new and direct revelation or inspiration, then that individual almost invariably develops himself towards libertinism. Perhaps this fact is more notorious when we find men in masses, as in the various sects that spring up from time to time. William Dorrel who, seventy-five years ago, proclaimed himself the Messiah up in Franklin county, counseled promiscuous intercourse of the sexes and taught as vile stuff as our very natural poet Walt Whitman does now. The Mormons, with their new Bible, ran straight into the most disgusting polygamy; and Heber Kimball talks in the most promiscuous congregation of the saints as easily and freely of his 'cows,' as our 'poet of sexual purity' does of women. Spiritualism, whenever it has cut loose from the Bible as the only authoritative revelation from heaven, has gone just as naturally into free-love as water runs down hill. The very first social institution that falls into contempt after Christianity as a revelation is discarded, is Christian marriage, and of all the 'teachings' in the world, we know of none that so inevitably lead to impurity as those attributed to 'Nature.'</p><p>Now Walt Whitman is par excellence the 'poet of nature.' In his pure taste there is nothing unclean, because nothing seems unclean. Nature has free course in him, and runs and is glorified in all its issues. Those passions which degrade men and lead to nine-tenths of the crime of the world, he exalts. Those appetites which only a pure, true and life-long love can hallow, are with him appetites to be cherished and fed—no matter about the love. It ought to be enough for Walt Whitman, if he honestly thinks his book a pure one, to know that the pure in society will shun it, and that it will be sought out and laughed over by lewd women and prurient boys and hoary-headed old lechers,—to know that this notice of his volume will stir to read it only the dregs of the social and moral world into which it goes. That settles the question. When men and women are led by their higher affinities, they will be led straight away from Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass.' Otherwise, otherwise.</p><p>If ever there was a period when poetry needed a Luther now is the time. The vine long unpruned has run itself to waste; graceful lines, spiral tendrils, flaunting leaves, but very little fruit. The reformer and the vine-dresser are at hand—do you think we will let him go on unmolested? Never; there will be a hard fight. We are attached to old abuses, we love the shadow of the vine, and smoke the pipe of peace under it, watching those exquisite twistings and turnings of branch and tendril. The fevered lips of the poor are parched-there are no grapes to cool their system. Ma foi, why don't they send to Malaga? We gain our living pointing out to each other the exquisite ground-and-lofty tumblings of agile creepers, running here, there, everywhere. Hang your grapes!</p><p>Hang your reformers! They have sent the exquisite refinement and easy-flowing lines of the renaissance-period flying, they would revive a task for Nature;—teach us to walk instead of dancing the pas rococo of blessed Louis Quatorze;—revere and respect cocked-hats and small clothes of the Revolution, and neglect the tunic and toga. They would have us quit bragging about the exquisite beauty of Homer as we read it in the vernacular and woundily vowing how impossible it is to read Quevredo, or Dante, Racine, or Goethe in a translation; they would have us believe that their marrow has been long since collected and digested by those ignorant of everything save English, and that we are now crowing over a bag of bones! This is woful!</p><p>Here is a man—WALT WHITMAN—coming smack at our aesthetical vine with a large knife—a bowie-knife. What is it best to do? Those old-world conquerors, the Romans, carried just such tools, and Americans of all nations now extant, are the only ones daring to wield such close-quarter reasons. Suppose we out rapiers, on guard, carte and tierce—now for the salute: by way of compliment let us ask him to thrust first at us; we drop our point by reversing the nails downward—with a circular motion; draw our right foot close by our left, stretch both hands; raise our right arm, and with our left-hand take off our hat gracefully. The devil! The man has rushed by us—made one drop—and the vine is good for nothing—but grapes!</p><p>He has placed before us his poems. And what collective name has he given them? Something sounding—something like 'Songs of the Faineant,' 'Lays of other Lands,' 'Seaside Dreams,' or the 'Muse's Meanderings!' Not a bit of it; but plain 'Leaves of Grass'—something cows eat and milkmaids wipe their shoes on. Then he has entitled his poems 'Proto-Leaf,' 'Chants Democratic,' 'Enfans D'Adam,' 'Poem of Joys,' 'Messenger Leaves,' 'Calamus,' 'So Long,' etc. etc. And here we have his portrait—a head of Homer painted by Hans Hemling—a good deal of primitive grit toned down by Flemish caution. A face for open air and the woods and psalms of muscle.</p><p>He sings very little for the opera, but for oyster-men and clam-diggers, and Western hunters and raftsmen, and farmers and red-cheeked matrons, and omnibus-drivers and mechanics; and for all true Americans, he whistles like an oriole of a warm May morning. He sits down by you familiarly, but not 'famillioniarely,' and tells you of Rocky Mountains, primeval forests, Southern bayoux, Northern lakes, Western prairies, Eastern rock-bound sea-shores, far-stretching prairies, scenes of sunlight, and fresh blowing air. He is great on politics, and the duties we owe our country. He advocates cleanliness, fresh air and exercise; he proves that because a man may be thrashed in a fight it is no reason that he was in the wrong. He is Consuelo for the poor man, the friendless, the outcast—he picks them up from the gutter and sets them up straight. If he has a dime in his pocket he evidently gives the poor devil ten cents of it. Certainly he is lacking in one of the chiefest of our attributes—making money. He tells you he is as good as you are, and that you are as good as he is—and evidently does not worry his great soul about trifles.</p><p>If you intend to sail in the same fleet with his clipper, you must first be careened over and scrape off the barnacles of old books, before you up sail for blue water.</p><p>He is the people's Poet, and spite of a belief that poetry only can be appreciated by the few, he goes in for giving it to the oi polloi. It's a fact that—</p><p>'When coarser souls are wrapped in sleep'—</p><p>we may out with a mandolin and sing to Leonores and Josephines—but we have to make it up next morning and we do sleep sometimes; so the poetic element in uneducated people as in the educated, sometimes and somewheres exist. Not a fierce revolution in this world's history but may be regarded as a grand psalm in the Book of Time, sung by the poets of deeds—the people.</p><p>This poet has a peculiarity. He calls a tom-cat a tom-cat; therein we differ from him. It is a well received truth that in our day it is politic to look at a great many things as they are not. We crowd to see La Dame aux Camelias, to hear the Traviata, but we do not call the French girl, or her Francesca Italianizata sister, by their old Anglo-Saxon name. The farthingale and silkworm cover a multitude of sins, and elegant language many a vile, voluptuous thought. We may not be Spartans;—it seems the prayer of Whitman that we may not degenerate into Sybarites, and to prevent this he uses the crash-towel of bold words.</p><p>America must make her distinctive mark. Already over our Past falls the bridal-veil of Romance, wedding it to the Future, though its thin cloud, its exquisite beauty and loveliness seem more bewitching than when it was our Present. In the Revolution of 1776 lie undelivered the subjects for a thousand poems to which the Iliad of Homer will be but as a rushlight to a conflagration. To the glories of our Past and the beauty of our Present, Walt Whitman awakes us; rough, bold, and free, he bursts out in the roaring old song that might have cheered the Old Continentals bivouacked for battle. And the words will thrill many a heart even in our day, clad though the body may be in homespun in far Western homes; grimmed [sic] though it may be by coal-dust and machinery, or wearing out life toiling away where brown earth, blue skies, pure air, green fields, and all God's gifts to man are driven ruthlessly aside that we may give more room for Mammon.</p><p>Before we condemn the book, let us read it. Before we cry out 'Eccentricity!' let us investigate our own centre, and the teapot we are making such a tempest in. There are two thousand roses to a drachm of the otto, there are untold thousands of poems in this duodecimo; you are given ideas! Now attention! present arms! Fire Words!!</p><p>Mssrs. Editors:—I do not ask a place for this letter in your columns because I feel that Mr. Whitman's poems need any justification; they justify themselves, and I have full faith that they will continue to do so long after the swarm of attacking critics are gone; nor do I hope to give more generous or appreciative praise to Leaves of Grass than you have given in your notice of the work, but because, being a woman, and having read the uncharitable and bitter attacks upon the book, I wish to give my own view of it.</p><p>I have read it carefully, and in reading, have found no page which made me blush, and no sentiment which might not be expressed by a pure man.</p><p>In humanity or art I consider that coarse and licentious wherein the soul is made subservient to the body. I am not shocked when I read the stories of the Old Testament: I see behind the apparently gross form, great meanings. Yet I find in the novels and the versification of modern literature, a subtle sensuality which, under the semblance of virtue, destroys all that is pure and elevated in the mind, leaving it enslaved by sensation and petty circumstance.</p><p>In Mr. Whitman's poetry, I see a breadth of view which overlooks distinctions. To him, nothing is base when used for a great purpose; he makes all things subservient to thought, and thus dignifies by his touch.</p><p>I find there an admirable courage. While we truckle to our bodies, trying to cheat ourselves and one another into oblivion of the potent physical facts, while we feed with exciting novels and amorous poetry those passions we dare not own, we are shocked, for sooth, when a great, earnest, sorrowful man gives us the facts which, gilded over with poor art, we accept readily enough: and when, with manly courage, he owns that he has sinned with prostitutes and felons, (and who has not?) we despise him. Was it not Christ who said of old, 'Let him who is without blame among you cast the first stone'?</p><p>I find in these poems great ideas, large, cheerful, healthy views of life. No sentimentality, no weak or misplaced passion, but a wisdom which looks through all, behind all, beyond all, which sees the tendency of things, and rests content that all is well. I find a reverence so great and tender as not to despise the meanest thing, knowing that Nature has fashioned everything through ages of patient toil; a reverence which sees in the mud and slime of the pond the same fitness and beauty as in the dainty lily floating above it; which holds the 'woman just as great as the man;' and a mother. 'The melodious character of the earth, the finish beyond which philosophy cannot go and does not wish to go;' a reverence which recognizes in the distinction of sex, that great principle which asserts itself from the lowest to the highest forms of vegetable and animal life, a mystery equally holy with the mystery of birth, the mystery of death.</p><p>I find there a generosity, giving without stint. Nothing is too precious, nothing too great, nothing too holy to be bestowed. The experiences which most men in their selfishness hug close, which they call 'too sacred for the eyes of the world,' Mr. Whitman, like a true poet, deals out largely.</p><p>And I find more than all these: I find a wonderful knowledge of history, of philosophy, of mythology, of language, of mechanics and geography, of the customs of all peoples at all times; a knowledge which could have been acquired only by hard and long-continued study.</p><p>I find the highest artistic merits. A measure at once original and melodious, into which the words form themselves so naturally that we forget it is measure, and are awake of the thought alone. It is like the sound of the wind or the sea, a fitting measure for the first distinctive American bard who speaks for our large-scaled nature, for the red men who are gone, for our vigorous young population.</p><p>Yet grand, wild, free, and natural, as is Mr. Whitman's poetry, it is not careless or hap-hazard, anymore than Niagara, the Mississippi, the prairies, or the great Western cities, are hap-hazard; it is the result of patient labor, of intense thought; for it is the highest art which most closely imitates nature. Here we see not only boldness of conception, but finish of detail. What is there so graphic in the English language that Mr. Whitman should be ashamed to place beside it the pictures of the 'Fall of Alamo,' 'The Mashed Fireman,' 'The Sinking Ship,' or any other of the hundreds of pictures scattered throughout the book. What so exquisitely delicate as to eclipse 'A Word out of the Sea.'</p><p>There are few poems which I can read with so intense a thrill of exultation at the greatness of my destiny, at the exquisite harmony and balance of the universe, at the boundless love brooding over mankind; that fill me with so strong a faith in the working together of all things for good, so great forbearance toward error—yet nerve me so resolutely to action, as these poems of Walt Whitman.</p><p>C. C. P.</p><p>THERE is a tendency in the critical mind of America, and, for that matter, of other countries too, to create wonders where in the natural course of things, no wonder, or a very small wonder, exists. Among American authors there is one named Walt Whitman, who, in 1855, first issued a small quarto volume of ninety-five pages, under the title of 'Leaves of Grass'. In appearance and mode of publication it was an oddity, this same small volume, which, it appears, the author had printed himself, and then 'left to the winds of heaven to publish.' By the booksellers of the United States generally the book was ignored, but it could be obtained by the persevering applicant. Walt Whitman was then about thirty-six years of age, a native of Long Island, born on the hills about thirty miles from the greatest American city, and brought up in Brooklyn and in New York. Mr. R. W. Emerson, it seems, recognized the first issue of the Leaves and hastened to welcome the author, then totally unknown. Among other things, said Emerson to the new avatar, 'I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere for such a start.This last clause was, however, overlooked entirely by the critics, who treated the new author as one self-educated, yet in the rough, unpolished, and owing nothing to instruction. Fudge! The authority for so treating the author was derived from himself, who thus described, in one of his poems, his person, character, and name, having omitted the last from his title-page:—</p><p>'WALT WHITMAN, an American, one of the roughs, a Kosmos, <br>Disorderly, fleshly, and sensual;'</p><p>and in various other passages confessed to all the vices, as well as the virtues of man. All this, with intentional wrong-headedness, was attributed by the sapient reviewers to the individual writer, and not to the subjective-hero supposed to be writing. Notwithstanding the word 'Kosmos,' the writer was taken to be an ignorant man. Emerson perceived at once that there had been 'a long foreground somewhere' or somehow—not so they. Every page teems with knowledge, with information,—but they saw it not, because it did not answer their purpose to see it.</p><p>The poem in which the word Kosmos appears explains in fact the whole mystery—nay the word itself explains it. The poem is nominally upon himself, but really includes everybody. It begins,</p><p>'I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs to you.'</p><p>In a word Walt Whitman represents the Kosmical Man—he is the Adamus of the 19th century—not an Individual, but mankind. As such, in celebrating himself, he proceeds to celebrate universal humanity in its attributes, and accordingly commences his dithyramb with the five senses, beginning with that of smell. Afterwards, he deals with the intellectual, rational, and moral powers; showing throughout his treatment an intimate acquaintance with Kant's transcendental method, and perhaps including in his development the whole of the German school, down to Hegel; at any rate as interpreted by Cousin and others in France, and Emerson in the United States. He certainly includes Fichte, for he mentions the Egotist as the only true philosopher; and consistently identifies himself not only with every man, but with the Universe and its Maker;—and it is in doing so that the strength of his description consists. It is from such an ideal elevation that he looks down on Good and Evil, regards them as equal, and extends to them the like measure of equity.</p><p>Instead therefore of regarding these 'Leaves of Grass' as a marvel, they seem to us as the most natural product of the American soil. They are certainly filled with an American spirit, breathe the American air, and assert the fullest American freedom. Nay it may be said also that they assert the fullest Yankee license. Respecting the latter feature, his American puffers, in the disguise of critics, charge the author with irreligion and indecency; and these charges are unblushingly reprinted by his publishers, among the critical recommendations of his performances, as if thereby they would attract a numerous class of prurient readers.</p><p>All this is undoubtedly an unworthy trade-trick, to be thoroughly denounced, condemned, and punished. That class of readers, however, will be disappointed, as the passages intended are only so many instances adduced in support of a philosophical principle; not meant for obscenity, but for scientific examples, introduced as they might be in any legal, medical, or physiological book, for the purpose of instruction. They chiefly relate to the sense of touch, and might be found in substance in any Cyclopedic article on the specific topic.</p><p>So much for the matter of the book. As to the manner, it is the same as that with which Mr. Martin Tupper has made us familiar in his 'Proverbial Philosophy,' and Mr. Warren in his 'Lily and the Bee.' There is nothing that we can see miraculous in such an imitation. The result is a rhapsody, somewhat Oriental in appearance, prose in form, but rhythmical in its effect on the ear, producing a disjointed impression, such as might be produced by a bold prose-translation of Klopstock's famous odes, which would then present so many unconnected assertions, expressed in extravagant diction. The style of the work is therefore anything but attractive—calculated rather to puzzle than to please. It is however, as a printed book, got up in a splendid manner, and is electrotyped for the sake of cheapness, the publishers evidently designing to sell it by millions, if possible.</p><p>Notwithstanding all its drawbacks, we have little hesitation in saying that they will probably succeed,—on the principle, perhaps, of the quack, who calculated there were many more fools than wise men in the world. No matter, if the fools are all made wise, by the perusal of these 'Leaves.' They may be; it is not utterly impossible; but we doubt it.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS, by Walt Whitman. Eldridge & Thayer, Boston.</p><p>It seems as if the author of Leaves of Grass had converted his mind into a mental reservoir by tumbling into it pêle-mêle all the floating conceits his brain ever gave birth to. He manifests no other sign of mental capacity; for we find no trace of judgment, taste, or healthy sensibility in the work. It is a book of poetry such as may well please twenty-one year old statesmen and philosophers, and people who pride themselves more in being able to read and write than able to think. Such poetry(!) is characteristic of a country like ours, where there is abundance of everything to eat and drink, and to wear, and good pay for labor.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS.</p><p>IT is now four or five years since we reviewed Mr. Whitman's Leaves of Grass. On that occasion we were spared the trouble of setting forth the new poet's merits, as he or his publisher was good enough to paste into his presentation-copy a number of criticisms from American periodicals, which we were satisfied to reprint along with a few extracts illustrative of the volume they recommended. We cannot treat a new edition of Leaves of Grass in the same way. It is, we believe, the sixth or seventh which has appeared in the United States, and shows, both externally and internally, that Mr. Whitman is now much too confident in his own popularity and influence to care for directing English reviewers in the way they should go. The volume itself is splendid. The type is magnificent, the paper is as thick as cardboard, and the covers, ornamented with an intaglio of the earth moving through space and displaying only the American hemisphere, are almost as massive as the house-tiles which, according to Mr. Gladstone, are produceable from rags boiled to pulp. It is a book evidently intended to lie on the tables of the wealthy. No poor man could afford it, and it is too bulky for its possessor to get it into his pocket or to hide it away in a corner.</p><p>This is simply astonishing to us, for Mr. Whitman reappears with all his characteristics. He is still</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, breeding;<br>No sentimentalist—no stander above men or women or apart from them,<br>No more modest than immodest—</p><p>in short, one of the most indecent writers who ever raked out filth into sentences. Such books as this have occasionally been printed in the guise of a</p><p>scrofulous French novel,<br>On grey paper with blunt type,</p><p>but this, we verily believe, is the first time that one of them has been decorated with all the art of the binder and the pressman. The odd thing is, that it irresistibly suggests its being intended for the luxurious and cultivated of both sexes. We are almost ashamed to ask the question—but do American ladies read Mr. Whitman? At all events, it is startling to find such a poet acquiring popularity in the country where piano-legs wear frilled trousers, where slices are cut from turkeys' bosoms, and where the male of the gallinaceous tribe is called a 'rooster.' The theory that the affectation of an artistic object will justify any conceivable mode of treatment has never been carried farther.</p><p>Poetry of so singular a kind deserves some degree of analysis. Mr. Whitman's first characteristic is, that he is an Emersonian. It is curious to observe the effect of the secondary Carlylism of Emerson on a thorough American rowdy. It is generally the weak through over-refinement who are imposed on by that philosophy which pre-eminently affects to disdain conventionalities; but here is a 'disorderly, fleshy, sensual' nature, which takes the disease in quite a new form. Mr. Whitman is a professed Pantheist, but he draws from his Pantheism some conclusions not dreamed of by his teachers. From the principle that all things are divine, he derives the inference that all things are equally beautiful and equally fitted for poetical treatment, and this is his justification for writing with the utmost minuteness on subjects on which Nature herself has sometimes been thought to command silence to everybody except doctors. Mr. Whitman's philosophy seems also to deny that man has any personality distinct from the rest of the universe. A very large part of his poetry is taken up with assertions that he is everything else, and everything else is he; nor do we remember to have come across a doctrine more convenient for a poet. It relieves one from the necessity of doing more than enumerating the various elements of which the moral and material worlds are composed, the various scenes of which they are the theatre, or the various passions they include, and then the enumeration may be closed with the remark that all these things are equally godlike, or are equally dear to the poet, or are equally part of him, or have an equal claim on him as a part of themselves. We take, almost at random, the following passage, to give a notion of Emersonianism done into verse by Mr. Whitman:—</p><p>Good in all,<br>In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals,<br>In the annual return of the seasons,<br>In the hilarity of youth;<br>In the strength and flush of manhood,<br>In the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age,<br>In the superb vistas of Death.</p><p>Wonderful to depart!<br>Wonderful to be here!<br>The heart, to jet the all-alike and innocent blood,<br>To breathe the air, how delicious!<br>To speak! to walk! to seize something by the hand!<br>To prepare for sleep, for bed—to look on my rose-coloured flesh,<br>To be conscious of my body, so amorous, so large.<br>To be this incredible God I am,<br>To have gone forth among other Gods—those men and women I love.</p><p>∗∗∗∗∗∗</p><p>I sing the Equalities,<br>I sing the endless finales of things,<br>I say Nature continues—Glory continues,<br>I praise with electric voice,<br>For I do not see one imperfection in the universe,<br>And I do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the universe.</p><p>These lines will show that Mr. Whitman has adopted a metre which, like his philosophy, is calculated to make the labour of writing poetry much slighter than it has been usually considered. He has a better ear than Mr. Tupper,1 and his versification has occasionally a vague rhythm about it, but it is evidently the free and easy Tupperian pseud-hexameter which he has taken for his model. The elasticity of the rules by which this peculiar metre is governed here and there receives startling illustration in Leaves of Grass, as in the last two verses of the following extract:—</p><p>Who are you, indeed, who would talk or sing in America?<br>Have you studied out MY LAND, its idioms and men?<br>Have you learned the physiology, phrenology, politics, geography, pride, <br>freedom, friendship, of my land? its substratums and objects?<br>Have you considered the organic compact of the first day of the first year <br>of the independence of The States, signed by the Commissioners,<br> ratified by The States, and read by Washington at the head of the <br>army?</p><p>The same metrical oddities appear in another passage, which we quote because it gives us Mr. Whitman's description—doubtless a faithful one—of himself and his habits:—</p><p>His shape arises,<br>Arrogant, masculine, näive, rowdyish,<br>Laugher, weeper, worker, idler, citizen, countryman,<br>Saunterer of woods, stander upon hills, summer swimmer in rivers or by <br>the sea,<br>Of pure American breed, of reckless health, his body perfect, free from <br>taint from top to toe, free forever from headache and dyspepsia,<br> clean-breathed,<br>Ample-limbed, a good feeder, weight a hundred and eighty pounds, full-<br> blooded, six feet high, forty inches round the breast and back,<br>Countenance sun-burnt, bearded, calm, unrefined,<br>Reminder of animals, meeter of savage and gentleman on terms,</p><p>∗∗∗∗∗∗</p><p>Never offering others, always offering himself, corroborating his phre-<br>nology,<br>Voluptuous, inhabitive, combative, conscientious, alimentive, intuitive, <br>of copious friendship, sublimity, firmness, self-esteem, comparison, <br>individuality, form, locality, eventuality,<br>Avowing by life, manners, works, to contribute illustrations of results of <br>The States,<br>Teacher of the unquenchable creed, namely, egotism,<br>Inviter of others continually henceforth to try their strength against his.</p><p>It will be seen that Mr. Whitman calls himself 'näive,' in the feminine. One of his peculiarities is that he mixes up French words, generally much misspelt and otherwise abused, with the English or American of his verses. In one poem, each stanza begins with 'Allons.' In another, the words 'Accouche; accouchez' form a whole line; and elsewhere he calls upon the world to 'respondez.' But if his French is a new ingredient in poetry, still newer is his American slang, particularly journalistic and debating slang, with which he sometimes fills entire pages. Nothing can be absurder than the way in which the commonplaces of public speaking are occasionally intruded, as in this couplet:—</p><p>I say, nourish a great intellect, a great brain;<br>If I have said anything to the contrary, I hereby retract it.</p><p>Or in the following:—</p><p>I, an habitué of the Alleghenies, treat man as he is in the influences of <br>Nature, in himself, in his inalienable rights.<br>I do not tell the usual facts, proved by records and documents;<br>What I tell (talking to every born American) requires no further proof <br>than he or she who hears me will furnish, by silently meditating <br>alone.</p><p>The extracts we have given will perhaps lead the reader to wonder by what extraordinary hallucination as to the character of poetry Americans have been led to regard Mr. Whitman as a poet. Yet we are far from saying that he has nothing of the poetical fibre. He is certainly an unredeemed New York rowdy of the lowest stamp. He is absolutely without sense of decency. He has obviously no sort of acquaintance with the masters of his art, and his studies have been apparently confined to Mr. Tupper, his news-paper, and the semi-lyrical rhapsodies of the Boston transcendentalists. But his taste, now hopelessly perverted, seems to have been naturally delicate, and he has a very vivid imagination. When his pictures happen (as is rarely the case) to be neither befouled with filth nor defaced by vulgarity, they are, for the most part, strikingly presented. A sort of catalogue of scenes of American life, which, according to Mr. Whitman's easy method, is continued for half-a-dozen pages and results in nothing particular, gives a good idea of his descriptive power. We can only quote the beginning:—</p><p>Over the growing sugar—over the cotton plant—over the rice in its low <br>moist field,<br>Over the sharp-peaked farm house, with its scalloped scum and slender <br>shoots from the gutters,<br>Over the western persimmon—over the long-leaved corn—over the deli-<br>cate blue-flowered flax,<br>Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with <br>the rest,<br>Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze,<br>Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low <br>scragged limbs,<br>Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the <br>brush,<br>Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,<br>Where the bat flies in the Seventh Month eve—Where the great gold- <br>bug drops through the dark,<br>Where the flails keep time on the barn floor,<br>Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the <br>meadow,<br>Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering <br>of their hides,<br>Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen—Where andirons straddle <br>the hearth-slab- Where cob-webs fall in festoons from the rafters,<br>Where trip-hammers crash—Where the press is whirling its cylinders,<br>Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes out of its ribs—</p><p>there, and everywhere else, is Mr. Whitman.</p><p>We conclude with some lines which are more like true poetry than anything else in the volume. They are fished out from the very midst of a sea of foul impurities:—</p><p>Press close, bare-bosomed Night Press close, magnetic, nourishing <br>Night!<br>Night of south winds! Night of the large few stars!<br>Still, nodding night! Mad, naked, summer night.<br>Smile, O voluptuous, cool-breathed Earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset! Earth of the mountains, misty-topt!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon, just tinged with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid grey of clouds, brighter and clearer for my sake!<br>Far-swooping elbowed Earth! Rich, apple-blossomed Earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes!<br>Prodigal, you have given me love! Therefore I to you give love!<br>O unspeakable passionate love!</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS.</p><p>NOT the least surprising thing about this book is its title. Had it been called 'Stenches from the Sewer,' 'Garbage from the Gutter,' or 'Squeals from the Sty,' we could have discerned the application. But 'leaves'—which, we take it, is the Transatlantic for blades—'of grass' have nothing of irreligion or indecency about them. Mr. Walt Whitman—for it is with that choice spirit we are now dealing—might as well let them alone.</p><p>It is, for reasons we shall presently specify, rather a difficult matter to give the class of readers for whom we write, any adequate notion of this remarkable volume. Let them, however, imagine a Mormon, a medical student, and Miss Eugenie Plummer combining to draw up a treatise in the style of 'Proverbial Philosophy,' and they will have a faint idea of the last production of Mr. Walt Whitman.</p><p>The folly of the work is its least defect. The gregarious qualities of birds of a feather furnish matter for a very common aphorism, and we therefore see no reason to question the correctness of the subjoined assertion:—</p><p>'The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,<br>Ya-honk! he says, and sounds it down to me like an <br>invitation;<br>The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listen close,<br>I find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry <br>sky.'</p><p>The following forms the conclusion of a pretty long rhapsody of the author concerning himself. We extract it because it is more decent and not more foolish than the rest of the volume:—</p><p>'I too am not a bit tamed—I too am untranslatable,<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p><p>The last scud of day holds back for me,<br>It flings my likeness, after the rest, and true as any, <br>on the shadowed wilds,<br>It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.</p><p>I depart as air—I shake my white locks at the run-away <br>sun,<br>I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.</p><p>I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I<br> love,<br>If you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles.</p><p>'You will hardly know who I am, or what I mean,<br>But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,<br>And filter and fibre your blood.</p><p>Failing to fetch me at first, keep encouraged,<br>Missing me one place, search another,<br>I stop somewhere waiting for you.'</p><p>It is related of poor crazy Nat Lee that when a small poet asked him if it was not very easy to write like a madman, he replied, 'No; but it is very easy indeed to write like a fool, as you do.' Doubtless Mr. Walt Whitman imagines he is writing like a madman, when, as a matter of fact, he is only writing like Nat Lee's friend.</p><p>He tells us that the world is not devout enough—that he understands 'Him who was crucified;' and in general tries to impress upon us that he is an apostle of no mean pretensions. But his creed, so far as we understand it, consists in a peculiarly coarse materialism. He tells us pretty roundly that he worships his own body, and people who would like to learn a great number of particulars about Mr. Walt Whitman's body, may find them in Mr. Walt Whitman's book.</p><p>Throughout the work there is a tone of consistent impurity which reaches its climax in some compositions entitled 'Enfans d'Adam'—a designation which we can only explain by imagining it to contain some allusion to the Adamites, of which interesting, though as we had supposed, extinct sect, Mr. Walt Whitman is a very fair representative. For the downright foulness of some of these passages we do not believe that a parallel could be found even by ransacking the worst classical poets from Aristophanes to Ausonius, and we are rather surprised that with John Lord Campbell on the woolsack, and a certain act of his still unrepealed on the statute-book, Mr. Walt Whitman should have found a London vendor for his uncleanly work.</p><p>This is more decided language than we generally employ, and our readers may ask us for some justification of it. Let us remind them of Lord Macaulay's description of Wycherley, which we can certainly apply to Walt Whitman. 'His indecency is protected against the critics as a skunk is protected against the hunters. It is safe because it is too filthy to handle, and too noisome even to approach.' There are certain criminals whom even literary judges must try with closed doors, and our readers must deduce from our verdict that 'the evidence is unfit for publication.' We say, then, deliberately, that of all the writers we have ever perused, Mr. Walt Whitman is the most silly, the most blasphemous, and the most disgusting; if we can think of any stronger epithets, we will print them in a second edition.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS.</p><p>AMERICA is unreasonably impatient to possess a great national poet as intrinsically her own as Shakespeare is English, Burns Scotch, Goethe German, and Dante Italian. She may have an emperor sooner—ubsit omen! Young as she is, the land of the stars and stripes has within her plenty of the stuff of which emperors can be made; but poets are a choicer growth, and need more years than the Union numbers from its birth to acclimatize their race in a new country. Of the few poets born in America, not one is distinctively American in his poetry; all are exotics, and their roots are nurtured by pabulum imported from the old country. In process of time, the foreign stock will accommodate itself to the new conditions by which it is surrounded; it will gradually undergo a transformation of species and become racy of the soil, but the soil itself must meanwhile pass through a corresponding change. It is still too crude; there is in it, as Oliver Wendell Holmes avows, 'no sufficient flavour of humanity,' such as inheres in every inch of ground belonging to some of the ancient seats of civilization. These truths are plainly discerned by the most cultivated minds in the States, and by them only; others believe that a great poet has actually arisen amongst them, and they hail his appearance with the more rapture because there has certainly never been anything like him in the guise of a poet since the world began. In the year 1855, this prodigy, this 'compound of the New England transcendentalist and the New York rowdy,' as a friendly critic calls him with literal truth, put forth the first issue of his 'Leaves of Grass'—videlicet Scurvy grass—twelve poems, or rather bundles, in ninety-five pages, small quarto. The book was immediately pronounced by Ralph Waldo Emerson to be 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.' Other critics followed suit, and Walt Whitman became as famous as the author of the Book of Mormon. A second edition of his 'Leaves of Grass,' with twenty additional bundles, making together 384 pages, was published within a year after the first; and now there lies before us a new, enlarged, and glorified edition, for which the publishers 'confidently claim recognition as one of the finest specimens of modern book-making.' The paper, print, and binding are indeed superb; but one thing these gentlemen have forgotten: where are the phallic emblems, and the figures of Priapus and the Satyrs that should have adorned the covers and the pages of this new gospel of lewdness and obscenity? Its frontispiece should have been, not the head and shoulders of the author, but a full-length portrait drawn as he loves to depict himself in his 'poems'—naked as an Anabaptist of Munster,1 or making love like Diogenes coram populo—with his own lines for inscription:—</p><p>'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, breeding,<br>No sentimentalist—no stander above men and women, or apart from them,<br>No more modest than immodest.</p><p>∗∗∗∗∗∗</p><p>Arrogant, masculine, naïve, rowdyish,<br>Laugher, weeper, worker, idler, citizen, countryman,<br>Saunterer of the woods, stander upon hills, summer swimmer in rivers or<br> by the sea,<br>Of pure American breed, of reckless health, his body perfect, free from<br> taint from top to toe, free for ever from headache and dyspepsia,<br> clean-breathed,<br>Ample limbed, a good feeder, weight a hundred and eighty pounds,<br> full-blooded, six feet high, forty inches round the breast and back,</p><p>∗∗∗∗∗∗</p><p>Countenance sunburnt, bearded, calm, unrefined,<br>Reminder of animals, meeter of savage and gentleman on equal terms.<br>Never offering others, always offering himself, corroborating his phrenology,<br>Voluptuous, inhabitive, combative, conscientious, alimentive, intuitive, <br>of copious friendship, firmness, self esteem, comparison, individuality, <br>form, locality, eventuality.<br>Avowing by life, manners, works, to contribute illustrations of the results <br>of the States,<br>Teacher of the unquenchable creed, namely, egotism,<br>Inviter of others continually henceforth to try their strength against his.</p><p>∗∗∗∗∗∗</p><p>I too am not a bit tamed—I too am untranslatable,<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.'</p><p>Such is the man, and such the sort of poetry, which have inaugurated 'an athletic and defiant literature,' destined, it is said, to supersede for the great republic the effete theories and forms that still amuse the senile decrepitude of the old country. Vast beyond comparison are the immunities enjoyed by the new school of poetry; it needs no intellectual capital to work with, disdains all submission to the laws of art as well as to the restraints of common decency, and may yawp away to its heart's content, never bothering itself about such trifles as rhythm or melody, rhyme or reason, metre or sense. Never was there so free and easy a school, and surely its founder, who announces himself as a 'teacher of the unquenchable creed, namely, egotism,' will not find it a very hard task to teach the young American idea how to shoot in that direction. Walt Whitman's egotism is twofold—swaggering and brutish by virtue of his rowdyism, all conglomerating and incomprehensible by virtue of his pantheistic transcendentalism. As a rowdy, he asks, 'Why should I venerate and be ceremonious?' since, after the closest inquiry, 'I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.' Presently rising into a pantheistic strain he exclaims:—</p><p>'Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or <br>am touched from,<br>The scent of these arm pits, aroma finer than prayer,<br>This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.<br>If I worship any particular thing, it shall be some the spread of my <br>own body.'</p><p>A perfectly logical deduction from the premises. Since all things are divine, Walt Whitman's body, with each several part and function of it, is divine, and it becomes him to sing hymns to them all. To refrain from celebrating their praises would be rank impiety. Another corollary from the same principle is that there is not a pin's point to choose between good and evil:—</p><p>'What blurt is this about virtue, and about vice?<br>Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me—I stand indifferent,<br>My gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait,<br>I moisten the roots of all that has grown.'</p><p>All things being good, and equally good, all are alike fit for the poet's use, and he may jot them down pell-mell, without regard to order, proportion, or perspective. If he wish to cram as much poetry into his pages as they can hold, he has only to fill them with compendious inventories of all sorts of things. Pages by the score of Walt Whitman's poetry are made up of simple enumeration:—</p><p>Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,</p><p>is almost as rich a line as any among them, and so is—</p><p>Moses, Homer, Neptune, Hercules, Wat Tyler, and Tycho Brahe.</p><p>According to the Emersonian jargon, the Ego and the Non Ego are one. The 'eternal and universal I' embraces and comprehends all nature. Walt Whitman is everything, and everything is Walt Whitman. He is here, there, and everywhere at the same moment. He is not born yet; he is dead and buried, alive and kicking. He is his own father and mother, brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts, lots of cousins, and all their progenitors; likewise his own children, nephews, and nieces, and all their posterity, for ever and ever. He is you and I, and the beef we eat, and the butcher that kills it, and the fire that cooks it; and he got drunk upon himself tomorrow, and will wake with a headache yesterday. Our own heads ache in trying to make head or tail of some of the polyphone utterances of this Protean, ubiquitous, and multitudinous person. Here is a whole poem of his, hers, its, or theirs, printed in duplicate, the copy in the left-hand column being by Walt Whitman's Ego, and the other by his Non Ego, a writer in the New York Saturday Press:—</p><p>'1.

London: Trübner and Co.</p><p>Leaves of Grass Boston: Thayer and Eldridge. 1860–61. pp.456.</p><p>EVERY ONE RECOLLECTS THE STORY of the Scotch dramatic author who, when Garrick assured him his genius lay neither for comedy nor tragedy, asked him 'Where the de'il it did lie?' Now Mr. Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass' puzzle us nearly as much as the Scotsman's query did the great actor. Are we criticising in these 'Leaves' prose or poetry? or rather something of an epicene gender, which unites in itself the bad qualities of both one and the other? So far as our perusal of the handsome volume before us has extended—and we must admit that nothing can be more tasteful than its paper and typography—we have scarcely been able to find a single consecutive sentence or expression out of which a meaning can be cudgelled. Taking an odd line here and there, and sometimes even as many as half a dozen, we can extract some hazy nonsense out of them; but what they have to do with those which go before or follow, or why they should be styled 'Chants Democratic,' or 'A Leaf of Faces,' or 'Calamus,' or anything else but 'sheer nonsense,' we have in vain tried to find out. Nor are we, that we know of, dealing with the productions of a lunatic. Mr. Walt Whitman is sane enough to do the poetry for an American newspaper or two: from whose columns these Leaves are reprints. In this degenerate land of Britain the only persons who nowadays keep a poet are, we believe, the members of an eminent Jewish clothing firm; and though we do not profess to be well versed in the lays of the bard in question, our impression is that they are quite as musical, and at least ten times as intelligible, as these 'Leaves of Grass'. After all, a horrible idea strikes us that our native land is not entirely guiltless of the paternity of this production. Can it be possible that Mr. Tupper's 'Proverbial Philosophy' has inspired Mr. Walt Whitman with the idea of his Leaves? We have most of us probably heard and read of persons who solved mathematical problems or composed poetry while asleep; and we think it just possible that the author of 'Proverbial Philosophy' may unconsciously, while suffering from a fit of the nightmare, have had something to do with the composition of these American Leaves. At least we trace in them some wild fantastic resemblance to his style; such as to make us pretty sure that Mr. Whitman has occasionally 'tasted the simple store and rested one soothing hour' with the English poetaster whose words we quote.</p><p>We give the five opening paragraphs or stanzas of a lucubration headed simply 'Walt Whitman.'</p><p>I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs to you.</p><p>I loafe and invite my Soul,<br>I lean and loafe at my ease, observing a spear of summer grass.</p><p>Houses and rooms are full of perfumes—the shelves are crowded with perfumes,<br>I breathe the fragrance myself, and know it and like it,<br>The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.</p><p>The atmosphere is not a perfume—it has no taste of the distillation, it is odourless,<br>It is for my mouth forever—I am in love with it,<br>I will go to the bank by the wood, and become undisguised and naked,<br>I am mad for it to be in contact with me.</p><p>The smoke of my own breath,<br>Echoes, ripples, buzzed whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,<br>My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air <br>through my lungs,<br>The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore, and dark-coloured sea- <br>rocks, and of hay in the barn.<br>The sound of the belched words of my voice, words loosed to the eddies of the wind,<br>A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,<br>The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,<br>The delight alone, or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides,<br>The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting <br>the sun.</p><p>Now we assure our readers that these 'belched words,' to speak à la Walt Whitman, are a perfectly fair, honest specimen of the four hundred and fifty-six pages of the volume before us.</p><p>'Walt Whitman' extends over eighty pages, and contains three hundred and seventy-two paragraphs and stanzas. We are particular in stating these items; and lest our readers should suppose we are unfairly mutilating this production, we assure them that we give each paragraph in full in making the following extracts, and that, so far as we can make out, each is perfect in itself.</p><p>In the ninety-sixth stanza we are asked</p><p>What is man anyhow? What am I? What are you?</p><p>Possibly the four following paragraphs which we quote may be supposed to answer this question:</p><p>All I mark as my own, you shall offset it with your own,<br>Else it were time lost listening to me.<br>I do not snivel that snivel the world over.<br>That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and filth, the end but threadbare crape,<br>That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at <br>and tears.<br>Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids —conformity goes to the <br>fourth-removed,<br>I cock my hat as I please, indoors or out.<br>Why should I pray? Why should I venerate and be ceremonious?</p><p>Our poet goes on to say (105):</p><p>I know I am august,<br>I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,<br>I see that the elementary laws never apologise,<br>I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.</p><p>And again (109):</p><p>I am the poet of the body,<br>And I am the poet of the soul.</p><p>Presently he dissects his own individuality a little more closely:</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, breeding,<br>No sentimentalist—no stander above men and women, or apart from them,<br>No more modest than immodest.</p><p>Unscrew the locks from the doors!<br>Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!</p><p>Whoever degrades another degrades me,<br>And whatever is done or said returns at last to me,<br>And whatever I do or say, I also return.</p><p>Through me the afflatus surging and surging—through me the current and index.</p><p>I speak the pass-word primeval—I give the sign of democracy,<br>By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the <br>same terms.</p><p>The succeeding 'voices,' though, as the writer tells us, they are 'voices indecent, by me clarified and transfigured,' strike us, so far as they can be conjectured to mean anything, as retaining all their pristine indecency.</p><p>And in this way our American nonsense-verse writer maunders on for some hundred pages, sometimes 'doting on himself—there is that lot of me, and all is so luscious;' now 'snuffing the sidle of evening,' whatever that may be; or asking—</p><p>Do I contradict myself?<br>Very well, then, I contradict myself;<br>I am large—I contain multitudes.</p><p>Verily we for once agree with him when he says:</p><p>I am untranslatable:<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p><p>One of the most curious whims of Mr. Walt Whitman is to give his readers from time to time inventories of the various component parts of some thing or person. Thus (in pages 300-2) we might for a brief moment fancy ourselves poring over a manual of surgery. The mention of the word 'body' enables him to write down about one hundred and fifty different items which belong, or may be supposed by poetical licence to belong, to the human form divine. Some of the terms, as 'neck-slue,' 'man-balls,' 'inward and outward rounds,' 'the flex of the mouth,' are to us rather vague; and we scarcely wonder at their exciting 'the curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of his own body or another person's body.' So again we have lists, extending over more than a page, or an iron-monger's and carpenter's shop or store, &c. &c., interspersed with such lyric strophes as the following:</p><p>Because you are greasy or pimpled, or that you was once drunk, or a thief, or <br>diseased, or rheumatic, or a prostitute, or are so now, or from frivolity or impo-<br>tence, or that you are no scholar, and never saw your name in print, do you give <br>in that you are any less immortal?</p><p>There are some other specimens of Mr. Walt Whitman's muse—for we have now discovered that this amazing rubbish is meant for poetry—which we had rather not quote, for decency's sake; and we fancy our readers will by this time one and all be inclined to cry, Ohe jam satis! Nevertheless we have not altogether wasted their time. They ought to know that this pure unmitigated trash is read and admired by not a few persons in America; and that what would go far in England to stamp its inditer as a lunatic has earned in America for its writer a poet's crown.</p><p>Me quoque vatem<br>Pastores dicunt; sed non ego credulus illis,</p><p>says Virgil's modest swain. Not so, however, with Walt Whitman. He tells us many times over that he is a son of song; and that the 'daughter of the lands' (which we suppose means America) has been 'waiting for a poet with a flowing mouth and indicative hand'—a vision realised doubtless in himself.</p><p>We shall conclude with saying that one of the most curious traits of this volume is the crazy earnestness with which the writer believes in his own poetical infallibility. He is not only a poet, but the poet; not only a teacher, but the teacher. To be sure, it follows that if Mr. Walt Whitman really be a poet, and if the contents of this book really be poetry, what Shakespeare and Milton have written must be styled by some new name. Sense, grammar, and metre are but very minor parts in the composition of poetry; but nevertheless, pace Walt Whitman, poetry cannot exist without this humble triad.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS By WALT WHITMAN. Boston, Thayer & Eldridge. 1860 Washington, Philp & Solomons.</p><p>Every body knows how the critical soul of Jeffrey was vexed within him by Wordsworth's 'Excursion,' on the first appearance of that poem in 1814, and by the 'White Doe of Rylston,' which saw the light a year afterwards. The former production he greeted with the exclamation, 'This will never do!' and the opening words of his critique on the latter were graduated to a point no finer than to say, 'This, we think, has the merit of being the very worst poem we ever saw imprinted in a quarto volume.' If the Aristarch of 'Scotch Reviewers' were still in the flesh, and felt called, in the spirit of the Rhadamanthine motto which he placed at the head of the Edinburgh Review, to let no offender against the canons of criticism escape unpunished, we are pretty sure that in proceeding to pronounce sentence on Walt Whitman he would don the black cap with as much insouciance as Lord Braxfield when it became the pleasing duty of that model judge to administer the last rites of the law to a prisoner arraigned on some charge of sedition against the King's Government. 'Ye're a vera clever chiel man,' was the soothing address once made by this ornament of the Scottish Themis to an eloquent criminal at his bar, 'but ye wad be nane the waur o' a hanging:' and if such was the festive wit and humor which marked trials for political offences in Scotland as late as 1794, it is unnecessary to add that the year of grace 1814 was any thing but a year of grace to such 'English bards' as fell into the clutches of the Edinburgh reviewer.</p><p>We do not know that Jeffrey would have pronounced 'The Leaves of Grass' to be the worst poem ever honored with exquisite typography, imprinted on paper of irreproachable quality, but we are pretty certain he would have conceded to it the merit of being the strangest-born among all the intellectual freaks of nature he had ever been called to inspect and analyze.</p><p>Such of our readers as are blessed with good memories may recognise in Walt Whitman a former acquaintance, for the 'Leaves of Grass' which he here presents to us, pressed and dried in a new herbarium, first disclosed their verdant honors four or five years ago, and were then duly brought by us to the notice of the 'discerning public.' We then undertook at some length to characterize this singular production by saying that Walt Whitman, who describes himself as</p><p>——an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, &c.</p><p>was the 'poet of pantheism,' and that the book which he has here given us, in the shape of runic rhymes and bardic symbols, was incapable of classification under any of the forms previously recognised in the world of letters. Unique in his literary style, Walt is, like a genuine disciple of Spinoza, perfectly indifferent with regard to the matter that enters into the composition of his book. Things good and things bad, things decent and things indecent, things pretty to the eye and things ugly, things sweet to the taste and things bitter, things fragrant to the nostrils and things noisome, things smooth to the touch and things rough, are to him all one and the same. Accordingly the reader will find in this 'poem' an inventory (expressed in a style something like a cross between Butler's Hudibras and an auctioneer's advertisement) of all things good and bad, decent and indecent, pretty and ugly, sweet and bitter, fragrant and noisome, smooth and rough, enumerated in categories designed to exhaust the sensations of humanity and hold the mirror up to the universe at large.</p><p>M. Jourdain, in the play of Racine, was surprised to learn from his erudite master in philosophy that for more than forty years he had been talking prose without knowing it. It were no great wonder, after the success of Walt Whitman, if many persons who have never talked any thing but the most unmitigated nonsense should congratulate themselves on the discovery that they have all the while been Miltons in disguise.</p><p>A very remarkable series of poems, which have created the fiercest disputes in literary circles. With much that is undeniable trash, we find here and there passages which display strong ideality, rich imagination, and large descriptive power, such as the following:—</p><p>In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, storehouses, and the countless workmen working in<br> the shops,<br>And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof—and no less in myself than the whole of the<br> Mannahatta in itself,<br>Singing the song of These, my ever united lands—my body no more inevitably united, part to part,<br> and made one identity, any more than my lands are inevitably united, and made one identity,<br>Nativities, climates, the grass of the great Pastoral Plains,<br>Cities, labors, death, animals, products, good and evil—these me,<br>hese affording, in all their particulars, endless feuillage to me and to America, how can I do less<br> than pass the clew of the union of them, to afford the like to you?<br>Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you also be eligible as I am?<br>How can I but, as here, chanting, invite you for yourself to collect bouquets of the incomparable<br> feuillage of these States?</p><p>Leaves of Grass Boston: Thayer & Eldridge. Year 85 of the States. (1860–61.)</p><p>Better dressed than we ever expected to see him, Walt Whitman again makes his bow, but with purpose unabated to 'sound his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.' The sensations of the roofs under this process are, as may be imagined, various and strong. 'Some said that it thundered, others that an angel spoke.' The Christian Examiner, with the unctuous air of one who has just read without blinking the accounts of Joseph and Potiphar, Judah and Tamar, pronounces it 'impious and obscene.' Mr. Emerson sends word, 'I greet you at the beginning of a great career.' When doctors, etc. Well, we have gone to the book itself for a decision. The Leaves of Grass has been our companion out in the wild outlooks of Newport and Nahant, we have read it at night after following the throngs of New York by day, we have conversed with its music when the obligato was the whizz and scream of the locomotive which bore us across the continent, and have turned to it from the calm rush of the Father of Waters, from the loading here and there on its shores by the glare of pine-knot fires, from the eager crowd of men and women chatting, singing, gaming in the saloon, and we confidently announce that Walt Whitman has set the pulses of America to music. Here are the incomplete but real utterances of New York city, of the prairies, of the Ohio and Mississippi,—the volume of American autographs. To these formidable eyes the goddess Yoganidra, who veils the world in illusion, surrenders; to them there are no walls, nor fences, nor dress-coats, no sheaths of faces and eyes. All are catalogued by names, appraised, and his relentless hammer comes down on the right value of each.</p><p>We can not dwell on this remarkable work as much as we would like, because we wish to place here some extracts.</p><p>'O truth of the earth! O truth of things, I am determined to press my way toward you;<br>Sound your voice! I scale mountains, or dive in the sea after you.'</p><p>'I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent in any iota of the <br>world.'</p><p>Voices.</p><p>'Oh, what is it in me that makes me tremble so at Voices?<br>Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her I shall follow, as the waters <br>follow the moon, silently, with fluid steps, anywhere around the globe.<br>Now I believe that all waits for the right voices;<br>Where is the practiced and perfect organ? Where is the developed soul?<br>For I see every word uttered thence has deeper, sweeter new sounds, impossible on less<br> terms.<br>I see brains and lips closed—I see tympans and temples unstruck,<br>Until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose.'</p><p>To a Common Prostitute.</p><p>'Not till the sun excludes you, do I exclude you;<br>Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you, and the leaves to rustle for you, do my words <br>refuse to glisten and rustle for you.'</p><p>The Child.</p><p>'There was a child went forth every day,<br>And the first object he looked upon and received with wonder, pity, love or dread, that <br>object he became,<br>And that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part of the day, or for<br> many years, or stretching cycles of years.<br>The early lilacs became part of this child;<br>And grass, and white and red morning-glories, and white and red clover, and the song<br> of the phoebe-bird,<br>And the Third-Month lambs, and the sow's pink-faint litter, and the mare's foal, and<br> the cow's calf,<br>And the noisy brood of the barn-yard, or by the mire of the pond-side,<br>And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there, and the beautiful curious<br> liquid,<br>And the water-plants with their graceful flat-heads—all became part of him.<br>The strata of colored clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint, away by itself—the spread of <br>purity it lies motionless in,<br>The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt-marsh and shore-mud—<br>These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who now goes, and will <br>always go forth every day.'<br><p>A friend of ours told us that once, when he was visiting Lizst, a fine gentleman from Boston was announced, and during the conversation the latter spoke with great contempt of Wagner (the new light) and his music. Lizst did not say anything, but went to the open piano and struck with grandeur the opening chords of the Tannhaser overture; having played it through, he turned and quietly remarked, 'The man who doesn't call that good music is a fool.' It is the only reply which can be made to those who do not find that quintessence of things which we call Poetry in many passages of this work.</p><p>We can not, nor do we wish to deny that biblical plainness of speech which characterizes these poems; we or nature are in some regards so untranslateable that in some of these pages one must hold his nose whilst he reads; the writer does not hesitate to bring the slop-bucket into the parlor to show you that therein also the chemic laws are at work; but to lose the great utterances which are in this work because of these, is as if one should commit suicide, refusing to dwell on the planet because it was not all an English Park, but had here and there a Dismal Swamp or a dreary desert. This Poet, though 'one of the roughs,' as he calls himself, is never frivolous, his profanity is reverently meant, and he speaks what is unspeakable with the simple unreserve of a child.</p><p>Who is WALT WHITMAN?</p><p>The person himself states his character, and replies to this question in the following general terms:</p><p>'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, breeding;<br>No sentimentalist—no stander above men or women or apart <br>from them,<br>No more modest than immodest.'</p><p>This is frank, but not altogether satisfactory. From the journals therefore, and from talk of those who know him, we gather that WALT WHITMAN lives in Brooklyn, that he has been a printer, and an omnibus-driver, that he wears a red flannel shirt, and habitually stands with his hands in his pockets; that he is not chaste nor clean, despising with equal scorn the conventional purity of linen, and the conventional rules of verse; that he is sublime and at the same time beastly; that he has a wonderful brain and an unwashed body. Five years ago, he gave to light the first edition of the 'LEAVES OF GRASS,' which excited, by its utter lawlessness, the admiration of those who believe liberty to mean the destruction of government, and disgusting many persons of fine feelings. We remember to have seen a brief criticism of the book in dear dead Putnam, by a critic who seemed to have argued himself into a complete state of uncertainty, and who oracularly delivered an opinion formed upon the model of the judge's charge in Bardell and Pickwick. RALPH WALDO EMERSON, however, took by the horns this bull that had plunged into the china-shop of poetical literature, threatening all the pretty Dresden ornaments, and nice little cups with gold bands on them, and pronounced him a splendid animal—and left people to infer that he was some such inspired brute as Jove infurried (sic), when he played Europa that sad trick.</p><p>But presently the bull—being a mere brute—was forgotten, and the china-shop was furnished forth anew with delicate wares—new-fashioned dolls, bubble-thin goblets, and dainty match-safes.</p><p>Nearly a year ago, the bull put his head through the NEW YORK SATURDAY PRESS enclosure, and bellowed loud, long, and unintelligibly.</p><p>The mystery of the thing made it all the more appalling.</p><p>The Misses Nancy of criticism hastened to scramble over the fence, and on the other side, stood shaking their fans and parasols at the wretch, and shrieking, 'Beast! Beast!'</p><p>Some courageous wits attempted to frighten the animal away by mimicry, and made a noise as from infant bulls.</p><p>The people in the china-shop shut and bolted their doors.</p><p>Several critics petted and patted the bull; but it was agreed that while his eyes had a beautiful expression, and his breath was fragrant with all the meadow-sweetness of the world, he was not at all clean, and in general, smelt of the stables, and like a bull.</p><p>But after all, the question remained,—'What does he mean by it?'</p><p>It remains yet—now when he stands again in front of the china-shop, with his mouth full of fresh leaves of grass, lilies, clover-heads, butter-cups, daisies, cockles, thistles, burrs, and hay, all mingled in a wisp together.</p><p>He says:</p><p>'I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs to you.'</p><p>And so proceeds, metreless, rhymeless, shaggy, coarse, sublime, disgusting, beautiful, tender, harsh, vile, elevated, foolish, wise, pure, and nasty, to the four hundred and fifty-sixth page, in a book most sumptuously printed and bound.</p><p>If you attempt to gather the meaning of the whole book, you fail utterly.</p><p>We never saw a man yet who understood it all. We who have read it all, certainly do not.</p><p>Yet there are passages in the book of profound and subtle significance, and of rare beauty; with passages so gross and revolting, that you might say of them, as the Germans say of bad books—Sie lassen sich nicht lesen.</p><p>WALT WHITMAN is both overrated and underrated. It will not do to condemn him altogether, not to commend him altogether. You cannot apply to him the tests by which you are accustomed to discriminate in poetry.</p><p>He disregards and defies precedent, in the poetic art. It remains for TIME, the all-discerning, to announce his wisdom or his folly to the future.</p><p>Only this: If he is indeed 'the distinctive poet of America,' then the office of poet is one which must be left hereafter to the shameless and the friendless. for WALT WHITMAN is not a man whom you would like to know. You might care to see him, to hear him speak, but you must shrink from his contact. He has told too much. The secrets of the soul may be whispered to the world, but the secrets of the body should be decently hid. WALT WHITMAN exults to blab them.</p><p>Heine, in speaking of the confidences of Sterne, and of Jean Paul, says that the former showed himself to the world naked, while the latter merely had holes in his trousers. WALT WHITMAN goes through his book, like one in an ill-conditioned dream, perfectly nude, with his clothes over his arm.</p><p>Leaves of Grass 12mo., pp. 456. Boston: Thayer & Eldridge.</p><p>If it be an essential attribute of poetry to afford pleasure and delight to the mind, in proportion as the latter is refined by culture, the performances, entitled 'Leaves of Grass,' have little claim, considered as a poem, to that title; for in no work of the same size have we ever read so much that is disgusting and repulsive. The author seems to exult in being as indecent, obscene, and profane as possible. This is the more to be regretted, because, in the midst of a great deal of the silliest twaddle, and the most unmeaning bombast, we find thoughts of rare beauty and striking force, wonderful felicity of expression, and imagery at once the boldest and most pleasing. Nor are the passages of the latter kind by any means few; although, undoubtedly, the predominating qualities throughout the book are coarseness and vulgarity; so that we often meet with whole stanzas which are too filthy to be quoted. There is a modesty in nature herself, which those who understand her will not overstep; but Walt Whitman (for this we understand is the name of the would-be Homer) goes beyond nature, or rather, in most cases he fails to reach her. Decency requires that we sometimes draw a veil over what is natural; but though such is hidden by common consent, it is not absurd or revolting like many of the images and precepts of Mr. Walt Whitman. We have, now, neither time nor space to illustrate our remarks by suitable extracts. We will, however, give two or three, which we think will sufficiently justify our views, if they do not give a correct idea of the true character of 'Leaves of Grass.' Such egotism and bravado as the following, are to be found at almost every page:</p><p>'I believe in the flesh, and the appetites,<br>Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part <br>and tag of me is a miracle.</p><p>Divine am I, inside and out, and I make holy what-<br>ever I touch, or am touched from,<br>The scent of these arm-pits, aroma finer than prayer,<br>This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.<br>If I worship any particular thing, it shall be some of <br>the spread of my own body.'—p. 55.</p><p>Be it observed, that this is chaste and decent compared to what follows, but which we take care to omit. Nor is he, generally, much more pleasing or poetical in his scenic descriptions. Thus in describing a sea-fight, he sings (?):</p><p>'We had received some eighteen pound shots under the water,<br>On our lower gun-deck two large pieces burst at <br>the first fire, killing all around, and blowing up over-<br>head.'—p. 76.</p><p>As a specimen of his patriotism, we give one stanza:</p><p>'To you of New England,<br>To the man of the sea-side State, and of Pennsylvania,<br>To the Canadian of the North—to the Southerner I <br>love,<br>These with perfect trust, to depict you as myself— <br>the germs are in all men;<br>I believe the main purport of these States is to be found <br>a superb friendship, exalté, previously unknown,<br>Because I perceive it waits, and has been always waiting in all <br>men.'—p. 374.</p><p>Leaving poetry out of the question, it would be difficult to find duller prose than this. Yet, as we have said, Walt Whitman can be occasionally musical, tender, and pathetic. As an instance, we quote a part of a death-bed scene, which is as beautifully drawn as it is truthful and touching:</p><p>'When the dull nights are over, and the dull days also,<br>When the soreness of lying so much in bed is over,<br>When the physician; after long putting off, gives the silent and <br>terrible look for an answer,<br>When the children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers <br>and sister have been sent for,<br>When medicine stand unused on the shelf, and the camphor smell <br>has pervaded the rooms,<br>When the faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of <br>the dying,<br>When the twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,<br>When the breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases,<br>Then the corpse-limbs stretch on the bed, and the living look upon <br>them,<br>They are palpable as the living are palpable.<br>The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,<br>But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously <br>on the corpse.'</p><p>Nor is this, by any means, the best we could cull from the pages of 'Leaves of Grass.' We have read and reread in it many passages much more exquisite; but nevertheless, we cannot regard Walt Whitman as a true poet. That he has genius there can be no doubt, though it is certainly not of a high order. In wading through his uncouth rhapsodies, we are reminded of the pompous, but generally empty speeches which Homer puts into the mouth of Paris, especially of that line in which he makes Helen inform us that the braggart libertine was but ill supplied with sense—</p><p>Τούτῳ δ' οὒτ' ᾶρ νῦν ϕρένεϛ ἔμεδοι, οὒτ' ἄρ' ὁπίδδωἔδδονται.<em>1</em></p><p>The publishers have done their part well. A better printed book, coming even from Boston, we have not seen in a good while. We have never seen Walt Whitman to our knowledge; nor do we know anything of him further than we learn from his book, but we think there is reason to fear that he will be too much read by a class of persons not capable of picking the diamonds out of the putrescent filth in which they are imbedded.</p><p>---</p><p><em>1. The Iliad 6.352-353: 'His mind is not firmly grounded, nor will it ever be; he will reap the fruits of this.'</em></p><p>Ekas, ekas, este bibelot, was the exorcism uttered by the grand mystagogue before beginning the ceremony of initiating an aspirant into the mysteries of Bacchus. Now, although we are no mystagogue, and do not profess a knowledge of Bacchic or other mysteries of that sort, we nevertheless feel inclined respectfully to request all merely pedantic, low—minded and profane persons to remove themselves out of this presence, while we speak of a man who is neither low—minded, pedantic, nor profane—Walt Whitman.</p><p>Ruskin says we should 'go to nature in all singleness of heart, and walk with her laboriously and trustingly, having no other thought but how best to penetrate her meaning; rejecting nothing, selecting nothing, scorning nothing.'2 That this man has been content thus to look upon nature in her unity and diversity, and to permit her to speak in her own mystic and beautiful language, is the secret of the wonderful fascination of his poems. Many individuals of the 'owl species' see nothing but Walt Whitman in these poems. He—'one of the roughs, disorderly, fleshly and sensual'—intrudes himself upon them in every sentence, and repeats 'the unquenchable creed—egotism' on every page. It is undoubtedly a grave offence for an author to thrust his personality between the reader and the truth which the book is intended to embody or set forth. But this is a grand poem of human nature. Man, his origin, nature, and destiny, and the grandeur of these, is the subject; and the author chooses to treat it in the first person, that is all.</p><p>'I celebrate myself,And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.'</p><p>This was the first sentence in the poems as originally published, and to us it was the key to everything that followed. We have been drawn irresistibly to the book, again and again, for there is a simple-minded and strong man speaking in his strength and simplicity. Walt comes to us, with his Leaves of Grass, a true child of nature—of the earth and the stars, and of what is beyond. He scornfully refuses to be judged by any ordinary, conventional standard of Art, for he, indeed, is no artist, but the born priest and hierophant of the mystic, unfathomable universe. He sees that everything is divine; that God is in all, over all, and under all; that there is nothing mean, without a purpose, or out of its place. He is so full of profound reverence for the old Divine Mother that she, in return, presses him to her bosom, and showers upon him all the wealth of her limitless love—so full of child-like playfulness, confidence and simplicity, that, as he 'leans and loafes at his ease, observing a spear of summer grass,' all her children press round him with uproarious, sunny laughters, weaving wild flowers in his hair, and kissing him with kisses that breathe the odors of heaven. To him the universe is a miraculum ingens, pregnant with profound mysteries; but he himself is also a miracle—the greatest of miracles. A soft whisper tells him that he is 'the acme of things accomplished.' All the ages have borne him in solemn procession from chaos and primeval night until now. Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me, Afar down I see the huge first Nothing—I know I was even there.</p><p>****</p><p>'Immense have been the preparations for me,<br>Faithful and friendly the arms that have helped me.<br>Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,<br>For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,<br>They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.</p><p>****</p><p>All forces have been steadily employed to complete and delight me:<br>Now I stand on this spot with my Soul.</p><p>****</p><p>The SOUL!<br>Forever and forever—longer than soil is brown and solid—longer than water ebbs and flows.'</p><p>He takes the loftiest views of man, reverences all his parts, and will not have any thing omitted. He is the poet of the body and of the soul, of the passions and the organs, and of all their manifestations, normal and beautiful, or otherwise. Truth, beauty, goodness, heroism, justice—these he recognizes, receives, and takes courage from them; falsehood, uglines [sic], depravity, cowardice and oppression—he sees these, also, with clear vision, but knows that God and Order reign, not Chaos and the Devil,—and therefore receives them, confident that, for a season, they too have their place. Of the sexes and sexual relation, no previous poet has spoken so freely and so well. This opinion will doubtless astonish many who have read the book. Nor are we surprised that so many find in the 'Enfans d' Adam' only the drunken and obscene ravings of a 'new, astonishing Phallus worship.' 'All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it.'</p><p>****</p><p>'All music is what awakes from you, when you are reminded by the instruments.'</p><p>There is such a deep and unmitigated vulgarity and coarseness in the inner life of the people, that no direct allusion can be made to the sexual relations without exciting simpering smiles and blushes, or rude, profane mirth. What of moral elevation, simplicity and genuine purity can there be in a people that persists in speaking of the limbs of a table or chair? We are disgusted with this substitution of seeming for being, and the insufferable cant and hypocrisy to which it gives rise. Thou, friend, who hast hitherto seen nothing but the madness of phallic processions in this poem, go wash thyself, make thyself clean, then return to it and reflect. Think of what precise thing thou hast hitherto made the phallus a symbol, and with what associations—what thou hast done to it when looking upon it! and then decide where the obscenity resides.</p><p>As for us, we heartily thank Walt Whitman for the clear, distinct, manly and pure voice with which he has spoken of these things, and hail it as the dawn of a wiser and better era, in which men and women will no longer speak of the limbs of tables and chairs. Nor will any pure and ingenuous mind torture this into an endorsement of rude, low and lascivious talk, but will rather receive it as the indication of an intense desire to be at once and forever free from all such.</p><p>We have much more to say of Walt—strong, brave lover of man, and uncompromising champion of man's rights, that he is—but must defer it to a more convenient opportunity. In the meantime, we would advise all who have escaped the dominion of the passions and the appetites, and who have any appreciation of the essential dignity of man and the grandeur of his destiny, to buy the book, and read it.</p><p>T.

The Iliad 6.352-353: 'His mind is not firmly grounded, nor will it ever be; he will reap the fruits of this.'</em></p><p>If Mr. Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass' had been printed on paper as dirty as his favourite topics,—if the book itself had presented the general aspect of that literature which usually falls under no other criticism than that of the police office, we should have passed it by without notice, as addressing only such a public as we have no concern with; but when a volume containing more obscenity and profanity than is perhaps elsewhere to be found within the same compass, presents itself in all the glories of hot-pressed paper, costly binding, and stereotype printing, and we believe as a fourth edition, it is manifest that it not only addresses, but has found a public of a much wider class, and it becomes a question how such a book can have acquired a vogue and popularity that could induce an American publisher to spend so much upon its outward setting-forth.</p><p>Perhaps loose thinking and tall talk are nowhere so efficacious in attracting notice as in the United States, and Mr. Whitman, by pretentiously assuming to be the exponent of Hegelian morality, by offering himself as the high-priest of that religion, whose sole dogma is comprised in the proposition Homo sibi deus [man is god to himself], attracts and perplexes readers, whose natural good sense would otherwise soon cast aside his frightful fustian. That he has any direct acquaintance with those forms of German speculation on which he falls back for the justification of the language he makes use of, we think may be confidently denied, not only from the manner in which he conceives its problems, but from the absence of any German catch words with which he would otherwise have infallibly adorned his motley, for even an ignorance of its grammar does not daunt him when the French language offers a term to his taste. Mr. Emerson has much to answer for, and will in reputation dearly pay for the fervid encomium with which he introduced the Author to the American public. That to the public defence of polygamy and slavery, should now be added that of the emancipation of the flesh, is an indication of a moral disorganization in the States, which is of every evil promise. That a drunken Helot should display himself without shame in the market place, speaks sad reproach to the public that does not scourge him back to his cellar.</p><p>In form these poems, if poems they can be called, are composed in irregular rhythmical lines, after the manner of Tupper, and in fact they may be described by the following equation,—as Tupper is to English Humdrum, so is Walt Whitman to the American Rowdy. They have been praised as containing many poetical passages; in this opinion we cannot concur. That sometimes a poetical expression occurs among a dreary waste of rhetorical verbiage may be allowed, but this might have been expected—a naked savage has often a wild grace of movement that a civilized man can hardly possess, but certainly not display.</p><p>These 'Leaves of Grass' are the symptoms of a moral fermentation in America, which no doubt will result in a broader and clearer life—but the progress is painful and the yeast nauseous.</p><p>FORMERLY everybody went to the East for marvels. Quacks got, or said they did, their pills from the Orient; astrologers sent to Egypt for stuffed crocodiles, and readers of romance pronounced the 'Arabian Nights' the most wonderful of books. Things have altered. The arrival of an East-Indiaman is no longer regarded as an event, and, acting in obedience to the prophecy of Bishop Berkeley—</p><p>'Westward the course of empire takes its way.'—</p><p>people now look across the Atlantic for the wonderful and strange. Every steamer from America bears a marvel of some sort or another. The old woman's tale of there being but eight wonders in the world has long been an idle story; a brick without the least straw in it, which fell to pieces the moment the first pedlar from Connecticut landed in Liverpool with a pine clock of home manufacture; the arrival, one after the other, of wooden nutmegs, scrubbing-boards, machines for doing all the reaping, washing, pill-making, shirt-sewing, and baby-rocking, only prove the inanition of the used-up East and the productiveness of the West,—or the Great West, as the playful Yankee prefers terming his native soil. There is one commodity, however, associated with the dusky East, which foolish people believe yet to come over in packages of tea and China jars—fine old unintelligible poetry, that imaginative compound which may be observed on the sides of tea-chests, and dancing over Indian porcelain. Ah, well! America now supplies that too, and the East is cheated out of a staple commodity.</p><p>At the present moment certain imaginative persons in the United States are engaged in crowning with laurel a new poet. Flaxen-haired Byronic youths have had their day, and now the path is cleared for the thick-necked 'navvy' school. We learn that in certain quarters the muscular poet is popular, and whilst all the young ladies here, dotted up and down our coasts and in green arbours, are trusting their imaginations to the bewitching 'Idyls' of Tennyson, their sisters across the water, at Saratoga, or the Falls, are in love with Walt Whitman.</p><p>It seems ridiculous, but still we are assured of the fact, that by many persons in the United States, the author of 'Leaves of Grass' is regarded as not far short in powers of inspiration to Our Savior. The parallel is impious and disgusting, and but for our knowledge that there are such people as the Mormons, and such institutions as the Agapemone,1 we should be very loth to believe that it was ever instituted amongst even the weak intellects of the sister country.</p><p>From the circumstances, however, we may learn a lesson. Civilization kept at a very high point of pressure, the economy of life too refined, nature put back into the shade too far, produces strange tastes and fancies that are unknown to health. There is a certain stage in disease, the doctors tell us, when the patient has a keen appetite after all sorts of odd things,—slate pencil, corks, or leather. So with the literature of a crowded and anxious people, it occasionally exceeds its proper bounds, suffers plethors, and puts forth pimples which diseased minds mistake for true health. Such unhealthy excrescences are the 'Leaves of Grass.'</p><p>It appears that in New York, some years ago, a rough fellow was employed in a printing office. Nature had given him a strong constitution, and his features were those of a dreamy sensualist. Now, it is well known that nothing in the United States stands still—a servant to-day, master to-morrow; now teaching a school in the backwoods, anon the head of a bureau at Washington; therefore there is nothing wonderful in the fact that Whitman was soon holding the pen of a journalist, and writing for a democratic paper. After trying various schemes for the exercise of his muscular pen, he hit upon what he conceived to be a new vein of poetry. The 'poetry' is not poetry, but 'verse'—and worse, and the 'vein' is of a kind that we are thankful is seldom opened. The metre of Longfellow's 'Hiawatha,'2 it will be remembered, was peculiar, and, upon first acquaintance, not remarkably pleasant, but it is music compared with Whitman's lines. Here are a few selected at random. They remind one of so many negro shouts:—</p><p>'Americanos! Masters!<br>Marches humanitarian! Foremost!<br>Century Marches! Libertad! Masses!<br>For you a programme of chants.'</p><p>Other paragraphs—or muscular verses, we suppose the poet would term them—read like cuttings from a backwood's newspaper, or notes from a stump orator's speech. At page 119 we have—</p><p>'What does it mean to me? to American persons, progresses, cities?—Chicago, Kanada, Arkansas? the planter, Yankee, Georgian,—native, immigrant, sailors, squatters, old States, new States?'</p><p>We believe it is the author's boast that he is the sole discoverer of the metre in which he indulges, and that its originality is the delight of his poetic admirers. But the leading principle of the book, where the sense is intelligible, appears to be the praise of muscle, rude force, a strong arm, a stout body, and such a love for the softer sex as we may imagine to be common amongst the lusty black vagabonds of Central Africa. The writer describes himself in several places.</p><p>'Free, fresh, savage,<br>Fluent, luxuriant, self-content, fond of persons and places;<br>Fond of fish-shape Paumanok (where I was born),<br>Fond of the sea—lusty-begotten and various.<br>∗∗∗∗∗∗∗<br>Aware of the buffalo, the peace-herds, the bull, strong-breasted and hairy;<br>Aware of the mocking-bird of the wilds at day-break,<br>Solitary, singing in the west, I strike up for a new world.<br>∗∗∗∗∗∗∗</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a Kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking,<br>No sentimentalist—no stander above men and women, or apart from them,<br>No more modest than immodest.'</p><p>But enough is better than a feast of this stuff. It would be impossible to transcribe from any part of the book without offending common sense, and it is difficult to select a passage that does not set all refinement and modesty at defiance. Any idea that presented itself to the author's mind, he appears to have jotted down as the poetry of inspiration. After this rule the whole vagrant thoughts of a London dustman or coalheaver, for twenty-four hours, would make a dainty little volume.</p><p>The very get-up of the book, with its rough bark-like binding, only bears out the author's idea of ruggedness. Nature without any trammels, in a sort of pre-Adamite costume of leaves, is what the author's mind continually runs upon. His portrait, given as a frontispiece, also assits the idea. his hair has been allowed to grow in an unkempt fashion over his face, his eyes look at you sleepily and sensually, whilst his shirt collar, undone, displays the hairy breast of a barge-man. In his verses he is continually speaking of love and brotherly feeling. Some time ago, so the story goes, he made the unpoetic acquaintance of a New York omnibus driver. The driver fell sick, and there, up and down Broadway for a fortnight, was the muscular verse-maker to be seen, with his sun-burnt face and flying shirt-collar, driving his friend's omnibus.</p><p>Think of Tennyson's 'fooling' a Putney bus, and Tupper3 behind handing people in and out! The circumstances came to the knowledge of some sickly sentimental readers, and forthwith Whitman's poetry was called for. Another reason of the rugged versifier finding readers, may be found in the fact that Emerson, on more than one occasion, has patted him on the back approvingly. We pity the philosopher's selection, and can only conceive that the patronage was accorded in the belief that the muscular scribbler was trying to speak the voice of nature;—that so filled had the found the world with sham, that even the vulgar inditings of an uneducated man, free from any Old World philosophy, or Old World religion, were, in his opinion, worthy of approbation. Of a truth that philosophy may be doubted which would reduce society once more to a farm-yard, with such pastoral poets to sing of love and nature as Walt Whitman.</p><p>'Sensation books,' or what are so called, are now the rage, and each successive production of this kind is more mysterious or murderous than its predecessor. Sir Rohan's Ghost,1 Households of Bouveries, Gold Bricks, and the like, are thrust down our throats whether we will or not. Their authors for the most part belong to the foggy or to the flippant schools of book-makers; for the former Emerson and his 'set' are partly responsible. These scribblers seem to fancy that it is a mark of genius to be mysterious; they hide one grain of thought in a bushel of chaff and have the assurance to ask us to look for it. Oh! for the days and works of Goldsmith, Addison and Irving, who drew from pure wells of English undefiled, and charmed us by their simplicity. The other day we noticed a commendatory notice (save the mark!) of Walt Whitman's Poems, by Emerson, and we looked over the volume of one who has been declared about 'to inaugurate a new era in American poetry.' Why, these 'poems' (prose run crazy) are the veriest trash ever written, and vulgar and disgusting to the last degree. There never was more unblushing obscenity presented to the public eye than is to be found in these prurient pages and how any respectable House could publish the volume is beyond my powers to comprehend. But enough of the 'nasty' school.</p><p>And now we have another 'sensation' book—an anti-slavery affair—one of the brood spawned by 'Uncle Tom.' It is called 'Harrington'; but it ought to be styled, 'A Glorification of Wendell Phillips, William Lloyd Garrison, Theodore Parker, C. Burleigh and other gentlemen of their peculiar way of thinking.' Burleigh is said to look like the portraits of Jesus Christ. Parker resembles Socrates, Phillips, Cicero; and Garrison, Jove himself. And then the female characters are marvels of beauty and virtue. The house of Muriel, the heroine, is a perfect paradise of upholstery. But the hero, Harrington, is one of those</p><p>faultless monsters, whom the world ne'er saw,</p><p>whose 'mission' it is to comfort the sable population of 'Nigger Hill.' It is absolutely sickening to read the manworship to be found in this volume, the only powerful writing in which is the description of Anthony's escape. As a work of art it will be as ephemeral as most books of its class.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS.—By Walt Whitman. Published by Thayer & Eldridge. Boston. In the 85th year of the States.</p><p>As for this man, 'Walt Whitman,' though he may chance to have been commended by Emerson, and, for aught we know, by a dozen other equally unscrupulous gentlemen, it does not any the less follow that he is a person whom one having respect for a good name would little care to recognize upon a public thoroughfare. As for that which he styles his poetry, armless, witless pointless though it be, it might perhaps have been passed by with a casual smile or ominous tap of the forehead; but for the deliberate and premeditated indecencies which it at embodies, there can be no excuse. It is high time that individuals such as 'Walt Whitman' and others of his school should learn that the encouragement of a purer and higher morality than that which now prevails, is not to be promoted by any such insane productions as this foolish 'Leaves of Grass;' and though a contempt for all rules of propriety, decency, christianity and grammar, may be the only lessons which he has drawn from Nature's teachings, fortunately for the world, the class of men who are equally degraded is small and insignificant.</p><p>That this volume may be purchased out of curiosity we can well imagine, but that the man exists who can sit down and deliberately wade through with such a mass of nonsense as appears between its two covers, we cannot believe.</p><p>Whitman may be a man of some talent indeed, portions of his book would indicate something of the kind, but it only proves that a little talent like a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. His tastes are certainly of the grossest and most vicious nature,and will keep him far enough from the Parnassian Mount, unless the morals of the sweet sisters have been sadly corrupted of later years.</p><p>A portrait of the author appears with his work, which will convey a much better idea of what he may be capable of than anything we can say.</p><p>In this little supplement, (a sort of wake after the ship,) appear to be gathered a portion of those notices, reviews, &c., (especially the condemnatory ones,) that have followed the successive issues of Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass. The history of that composition, so far, is curious. It has already had three births, or successive issues.</p><p>The first issue of the poems consisted of a thin quarto volume of 96 pages, in Brooklyn, in 1855. It comprised eleven pieces, and was received with derision by the literary law givers. The only exception was a note from Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p><p>The work sold, however, and in 1857 a second issue, a very neat 16mo. volume of 384 pages, was published in New York, containing thirty-two poems.</p><p>The book now in the market, the third issue, containing, large and small, one hundred and fifty-four poems, superbly printed, (it is indeed universally pronounced, here and in England, a perfect specimen of choice typography,) came forth in Boston, the current year, 1860.</p><p>Such is the book to which this curious collection of 'criticisms' refers. The poem itself, (for 'LEAVES OF GRASS,' all have a compact unity,) may be described, in short terms, as the Song of the sovereignty of One’s self—and the Song of entire faith in all that Nature is, universal, and particular—and in all that belongs to a man, body and soul. The egotistical outset, 'I celebrate myself,' and which runs in spirit through so much of the volume, speaks for him or her reading it precisely the same as for the author, and is invariably to be so applied. Thus the book is a gospel of self-assertion and self-reliance for every American reader—which is the same as saying it is the gospel of Democracy.</p><p>A man 'in perfect health' here comes forward, devoting his life to the experiment of singing the New World in a New Song—not only new in spirit, but new in letter, in form. To him America means not at all a second edition, an adaptation of Europe—not content with a new theory and practice of politics only—but above its politics, and more important than they, inaugurating new and infinitely more generous and comprehensive theories of Sociology, Literature, Religion and Comradeship.</p><p>We therefore do not wonder at the general howl with which these poem the 'Imprints' refer to, has been received both in America and in Europe. The truth about the poem and its author is, that they both of them confound and contradict several of the most cherished of the old and hitherto accepted canons upon the right manner and matter of men and books—and cannot be judged thereby;—but aim to establish new canons, and can only be judged by them. Just the same as America itself does and can only be judged.</p><p>Neither can the song of 'Leaves of Grass' ever be judged by the intellect—nor suffice to be read merely once or so, for amusement. This strange song, (often offensive to the intellect), is to be felt, absorbed by the soul. It is to be dwelt upon—returned to, again and again. It wants a broad space to turn in, like a big ship. Many readers, perhaps the majority, will be perplexed and baffled by it at first; but in frequent cases those who liked the book least at first will take it closest to their hearts upon a second or third perusal.</p><p>Permanency is written all over the poem, so far. Also, a peculiar native idiomatic flavor is in it, to many disagreeable. There is no denying, indeed, that an essential quality it takes from its author, is, (as has been charged,) the quality of the celebrated New York 'rough,' full of muscular and excessively virile energy, full of animal blood, masterful, striding to the front rank, allowing none to walk before him, full of rudeness and recklessness, talking and acting his own way, utterly regardless of other people’s ways.</p><p>The cry of indecency against 'Leaves of Grass' amounts, when plainly stated, about to this: Other writers assume that the sexual relations are shameful in themselves, and not to be put in poems. But our new bard, walking right straight through all that, assumes that those very relations are the most beautiful and pure and divine of any—and in that way he 'celebrates' them. No wonder he confounds the orthodox. Yet his indecency is the ever-recurring indecency of the inspired Biblical writers—and is that of innocent youth, and of the natural and untainted man in all ages.</p><p>In other words, the only explanation the reader needs to bear in mind to clear up the whole matter is this: The subjects ('amativeness,' &c.,) about which such a storm has been raised, are treated by Walt Whitman with unprecedented boldness and candor, but always in the very highest religious and esthetic spirit. Filthy to others, to him they are not filthy, but 'illustrious.' While his 'critics,' (carefully minding never to state the foregoing fact, thought it is stamped all over the book,) consider those subjects in 'Leaves of Grass,' from the point of view of persons standing on the lowest animal and infidelistic platform. Which, then, is really the 'beast?'</p><p>Those who really know Walt Whitman will be amused beyond measure at the personal statements put forth about him in some of these criticisms. We believe it was Dr. Dictionary Johnson who said that persons of any celebrity may calculate how much truth there is in histories and written lives by weighing the amount of that article in the stuff that is printed about themselves.</p><p>The notices, &c., in this supplement, from pages 3 to 64, refer in their allusions to the typography, &c., to the first and second issues of 'Leaves of Grass.' The paper, print, and binding of the present edition of the Thayer & Eldridge have, as we before said, received, as they deserve, unconditional applause.</p><p><strong>All about a Mocking-Bird.</strong></p><p>What is the reason-why of Walt Whitman's lyric utterances, as soon as any of them is heard, rousing up such vehement intellectual censures and contumely from some persons, and their equally determined bravos from other persons?</p><p>Passing by certain of the latter, the complimentary sort, with which the journals, welcoming Walt's reappearance and recovery of his singing-voice after an obstinate three years' dumbness, have accepted that Mocking-Bird Chant printed by us in the Saturday Press, of Dec. 24, preceding, we seize upon and give to our readers, in another part of the paper, a specimen of the sort of censure alluded to—a tip-top cutting-and-slashing criticism from the Cincinnati Daily Commercial, which we have conned with unfeigned pleasure. All of which is respectfully submitted as outset for something else made way to be said, namely:</p><p>We feel authorized to announce, for certain, that the Mocking-Bird, having come to his throat again, his cantabile, is not going to give cause to his admirers for complaining that he idles, mute, any more, up and down the world. His songs, in one and another direction, will, he promises us, after this date, profusely appear.</p><p>We are able to declare that there will also soon crop out the true 'LEAVES OF GRASS,' the fuller- grown work of which the former two issues were the inchoates—this forthcoming one, far, very far ahead of them in quality, quantity, and in supple lyric exuberance.</p><p>Those former issues, published by the author himself in little pittance-editions, on trial, have just dropped the book enough to ripple the inner first-circles of literary agitation, in immediate contact with it. The outer, vast, extending, and ever-wider-extending circles, of the general supply, perusal, and discussion of such a work, have still to come. The market needs to-day to be supplied—the great West especially—with copious thousands of copies.</p><p>Indeed, 'LEAVES OF GRASS' has not yet been really published at all. Walt Whitman, for his own purposes, slowly trying his hand at the edifice, the structure he has undertaken, has lazily loafed on, letting each part have time to set—evidently building not so much with reference to any part itself, considered alone, but more with reference to the ensemble,—always bearing in mind the combination of the whole, to fully justify the parts when finished.</p><p>Of course the ordinary critic, even of good eye, high intellectual calibre, and well accomplished, grasps not, sees not, any such ideal ensemble—likely sees not the only valuable part of these mystic leaves, namely, not what they state, but what they infer—scornfully wants to know what the Mocking-Bird means, who can tell?—gives credit only for what is proved to the surface-ear—and makes up a very fine criticism, not out of the soul, to which these poems altogether appeal, and by which only they can be interpreted, but out of the intellect, to which Walt Whitman has not, as far as we remember, addressed one single word in the whole course of his writings.</p><p>Then the workmanship, the art-statement and argument of the question. Is this man really any artist at all? Or not plainly a sort of naked and hairy savage, come among us, with yelps and howls, disregarding all our lovely metrical laws? How can it be that he offends so many and so much?</p><p>Quite after the same token as the Italian Opera, to most bold Americans, and all new persons, even of latent proclivities that very way, only accustomed to tunes, piano-noises and the performances of the negro bands—satisfied, (or rather fancying they are satisfied), with each and several thereof, from association and habit, until they pass utterly beyond them—which comes in good time, and cannot be deferred much longer, either, in such a race as yours, O bold American of the West!</p><p>Walt Whitman's method in the construction of his songs is strictly the method of the Italian Opera, which, when heard, confounds the new person aforesaid, and, as far as he can then see, showing no purport for him, nor on the surface, nor any analogy to his previous-accustomed tunes, impresses him as if all the sounds of earth and hell were tumbled promiscuously together. Whereupon he says what he candidly thinks (or supposes he thinks), and is very likely a first-rate fellow—with room to grow, in certain directions.</p><p>Then, in view of the latter words, bold American! in the ardor of youth, commit not yourself, too irretrievably, that there is nothing in the Italian composers, and nothing in the Mocking-Bird's chants. But pursue them awhile—listen—yield yourself—persevere. Strange as the shape of the suggestion may be, perhaps such free strains are to give to these United States, or commence giving them, the especial nourishments which, though all solid and mental and moral things are in boundless profusion provided, have hardly yet begun to be provided for them—hardly yet the idea of that kind of nourishment thought of, or the need of it suspected. Though it is the sweetest, strongest meat—pabulum of a race of giants—true pabulum of the children of the prairies.</p><p>You, bold American! and ye future two hundred millions of bold Americans, can surely never live, for instance, entirely satisfied and grow to your full stature, on what the importations hither of foreign bards, dead or alive, provide—nor on what is echoing here the letter and the spirit of the foreign bards. No, bold American! not even on what is provided, printed from Shakespeare or Milton—not even of the Hebrew canticles—certainly not of Pope, Byron, or Wordsworth—nor of any German or French singer, nor any foreigner at all.</p><p>We are to accept those and every other literary and poetic thing from beyond the seas, thankfully, as studies, exercises. We go back—we pause long with the old, ever-modern one, the Homer, the only chanting mouth that approaches our case near enough to raise a vibration, an echo. We then listen with accumulated eagerness for those mouths that can make the vaults of America ring here to-day—those who will not only touch our case, but embody it and all that belongs to it—sing it with varied and powerful idioms, and in the modern spirit, at least as capable, as loud and proud as the best spirit that has ever preceded us.</p><p>Our own song, free, joyous, and masterful. Our own music, raised on the soil, carrying with it all the subtle analogies of our own associations—broad with the broad continental scale of the New World and full of the varied products of its varied soils—composite—comprehensively Religious—Democratic—the red life-blood of Love, warming, running through every line, every word. Ah, if this Walt Whitman, as he keeps on, should ever succeed in presenting such music, such a poem, an identity, emblematic, in the regions of creative art, of the wondrous all-America, material and moral, he would indeed do something.</p><p>And if he don't, the Mocking-Bird may at least have the satisfaction of dying in a good cause. But then again he looks so little like dying, anyhow.</p><p><strong>Walt Whitman's Yawp.</strong></p><p>The review by the Cincinnati <em>Commercial</em> of Walt Whitman's last yawp, which (the review) you were frank enough to print in your last issue, emboldens me to speak my sentiments. When I opened the PRESS containing that extraordinary concentration of words, I said to myself, here's something nice for Mrs. U. to listen to, this night, after the little U's have curled themselves up in bed. Accordingly, the desired hour having arrived, I opened the PRESS, and enquired of Mrs. U. what she knew of Walt Whitman, and I am happy to say,—happy, after reading what the Cincinnati paper says about his 'Leaves of Grass,'—that she instantly disclaimed the remotest acquaintance with any one of that name. 'Then,' I proceeded to remark, 'he must be a poetic luminary of the first magnitude—a sort of Fresnel light—who has been, like Alexander Smith, hiding his brilliancy under dry goods boxes or flour-barrels, and now blazes forth to amaze the readers of the SATURDAY PRESS, and the rest of mankind. Listen; it's good, or it wouldn't be here.'</p><p>I began. . . .</p><p>Last Winter I got on skates, my first appearance before an icy audience for fifteen years.</p><p>Happily for me, I selected the night and a retired spot. Unhappily, that the—infernal, I was going to say, hyperborean is better—hyperborean idea ever entered my wretched head; and for its weakness that head paid a fearful penalty.</p><p>I cherish a vivid remembrance, that on that fearful night there was an irrepressible conflict between my several members. No two of them would go the same way, and when they did, it was not the way I wanted them to go. The only consentaneous movement which they seemed at all disposed to execute, was a spasmodic, unsolicited, and uncontrollable flight ad astra, in which my head foolishly refused to participate, and for its contumacy was left behind, the stars being so obliging as to come down in dazzling throngs to gaze upon my helplessness. I remembered the story of Miller at Lundy's Lane, of Bruce (was it?) and the historical Spider, who tried twenty times before he hauled himself up, and I didn't give it up so, O Editor! but 'tried, tried again,' until I believe the closed-up sutures in my cranium were opened as widely as if the brains were out, and a pint of white beans were in with the whole caput-al arrangement-soaking in the Anatomist's basin. Such a wild, heterogeneous insane Saint Vitus-like, poly-maniacal orgie, as my shapely and generally well-behaved branches went into that night, will never be forgotten.</p><p>I said I began to read Walt Whitman's Yawp.</p><p>Pardon my digression—I have been trying to say that I felt as I was reading, that Walt—whatever that stands for—was on his musical skates for the first time.</p><p>O Shakespeare, O Milton, O Longfellow, O Henry Clapp junior, Editor of the nicest paper in the country—I couldn't see it!</p><p>I told Mrs. U. so—I asked her what you, O Editor meant by publishing such wretched trumpery! She had not been favored with your confidence, and said she didn't know. But she didn't think it trumpery—she thought there was something in it.</p><p>As Mrs. U. is the poet of my concern, her suggestion to that effect was a strong point in favor of Mr. Whitman's barbaric Yawp.</p><p>Furthermore, as Mrs. U.'s fondness for poetry doesn't at all interfere with the clearness of my café noir, the lightness of my muffins, or the integrity of my shirt-buttons, I respect her poetical opinions to every extent consistent with my lordly prerogative.</p><p>So I attempted the Yawp again.</p><p>Like as Mr. Webster said to the dandy who asked him if he never danced, 'I never had intellect enough to learn,' so I say—and I say it with grateful humility—'I haven't poetry enough to understand Walt's Yawp.' More than that, I don't want to.</p><p>My private opinion expressed to you confidentially is, that Whitman found a lot of dictionary-pi going off at auction, bought it for a song, employed a Chinese type-setter from the Bible House to set if up in lines of unequal length, and then sold it to you as an original Poem.</p><p><strong>Literary Nonsense.</strong></p><p>The better class of literary men affect contempt for the variety of writing which is most in demand among the patrons of the prosperous weeklies and the paper-covered novels. Cobb has very little credit for corn, and the alliterative names of poetesses that so copiously illustrate our literature are believed to have achieved the noblest immortality they deserve, when conferred upon a fast trotting mare, or painted upon a stern-wheel steamer. It is the fashion, among certain of the elect, to look with contempt upon all the reading that really has a purpose in it—that feeds the life of the people directly, with food honestly adapted to their wants. Now it may be submitted that, to a man of culture, or to a man who has seen much of life, the florid style that so wins the popular eye is offensive. Yet that writing has its mission. It educates men to better reading. Less vivid coloring and less extravagant forms would fail to attract the insensitive eyes of the multitude. Once attracted and once fastened, they learn to detect the true among the false, and grow into likelier likings and juster judgments.</p><p>But the real nonsense of literature is not written for the people; it is written for men of culture by men of culture. The most insignificant stuff that ever was uttered has made its appearance in first class journals, and, by its position, claimed for itself consideration and admiration. 'Brahma' will be recalled as a poem that was issued in the first number of the Atlantic Monthly. It was stared at, talked about, travestied, paraphrased, parodied, admired, ridiculed, stuffed, and treated with the most flattering consideration. Why? Because it appeared in a first class magazine, and was said to have been written by a first class man. Was there anything in it? Did ever a man get one idea out of it? Had it a mission in the world of mind? Nothing of the kind. It was an imposition upon the good sense of the public. Every man who threw down the poem after his unsatisfactory perusal of it, with the thought that there was a profound idea in it that he could not comprehend, was cheated and injured by it. It is wrong to thrust such unmeaning twaddle before the eyes of a public, earnestly seeking for a true culture,—to impress that public with the thought that there is wisdom in it, and that they are fools if they fail to find it. There is no medium like a very respectable magazine with very respectable contributors for transmuting inconsequential nonsense into incomprehensible sense.</p><p>But we had nearly forgotten 'Brahma,' and were only reminded of it by the appearance in the last number of the Atlantic of a string of nonsense for which one Walt. Whitman is responsible before the fact of publication. This poem is called 'Bardic Symbols,' if poem that may be which has neither rhythm nor rhyme. Walt. Whitman stands on the shore of Ocean, and says:—</p><p>'Elemental drifts!<br>Oh, I wish I could impress others as you and the <br>waves have just been impressing me!'</p><p>In these two opening lines we are admitted at once into the music of the poem, the unsophisticated character of the writer, and his desires and intentions concerning the reader. This is his first effort at 'impressing others':—</p><p>'As I ebbed with an ebb of the ocean of life,<br>As I wended the shores I know,<br>As I walked where the sea-ripples wash you Pau-<br>manok,<br>Where they rustle up, hoarse and sibilant,<br>Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her <br>castaways,<br>I, musing, late in the autumn day, gazing off south-<br>ward,<br>Alone, held by the eternal self of me, that threatens<br> to get the better of me, and stifle me,<br>Was seized by the spirit that trails in the lines under-<br>foot,<br>In the ruin, the sediment, that stands for all the wa-<br>ter and all the land of the globe.'</p><p>What a tremendous fix the author must have been in at the fearful moment when, held by that eternal self of him, which threatened to be too much for him, and floor him utterly, he was seized by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot! Poor fellow! No wonder that he subsequently exclaims:—</p><p>'Oh, baffled, lost,<br>Bent to the very earth, here preceding what follows,<br>Terrified with myself that I have dared to open my <br>mouth,<br>Aware now, that, amid all the blab whose echoes re-<br>coil upon me, I have not once had the least idea <br>who or what I am,<br>But that before all my insolent poems the real me <br>stands still untouched, untold, altogether unreached,<br>Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratula-<br>tory signs and bows,<br>With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word <br>I have written or shall write,<br>Striking me with insults, till I fall helpless upon the <br>sand!'</p><p>The stanza that follows this exhibition of the most extraordinary and unjustifiable conduct on the part of the 'real me' is full of pathos, and quite as full of truth:—</p><p>'Oh, I think I have not understood anything,—not a <br>single object,—and that no man ever can!'</p><p>Reader, the Atlantic Monthly, the best of American magazines, publishes two pages and a half of this stuff, and for what? For its literary merit?—it is a chaos of unmeaning words and a wilderness of bad grammar. For its thought? There is not a well-defined thought in it. For any hint of 'bardic symbols?' There is not a new one in it. The whole performance is execrable—a mass of half-crazy, half-idiotic nonsense, and, considered as a literary production, is a disgrace to the journal which gave it birth. If this production had appeared, word for word, in some modest country paper, it would had been seized upon at once by the press as a theme for immeasurable fun, like Mr. Tenney's immortal Fourth of July Oration. Yet, because some philosopher of the accepted stamp has indorsed the writer of this, and it has appeared in a magazine presided over by an excellent mind, it becomes respectable, and is blindly supposed to have excellencies, could they only be detected and measured.</p><p>There is something in the slang phrase 'good horse sense' which we like. It is a kind of sense which discards this whole class of productions—the mystical, the affectedly homely, the dreamily rhapsodical, the enigmatical—as things of no value, when, by the circumstances which accompany them, they fail to be things of mischief. They belong to the realm of nothings, and every healthy man and woman who has to do with things will despise them, and wonder how Maga can tolerate them for a moment.</p><p><strong>'Bardic Symbols.'</strong></p><p>Walt Whitman has a poem of this title in the April Atlantic.</p><p>Swift denunciation comes always from either ignorance or prejudice, or passion—no less in literature than in any other living affair; and it carries no force with it except to the ignorant, the passionate, and the prejudiced.</p><p>It is a pity that criticism should ever forget this; but criticism does; and the newspaper critic particularly seems to think that so he makes a great wind in his angry scoop, he carries conviction iwith him, and strikes dead the poet whose heart he cannot understand, and cannot find.</p><p>Walt Whitman has higher claims upon our consideration than mere magazine contributorship. He is the author of a book of poetry called 'Leaves of Grass,' which, whatever else you may think, is wonderful. Ralph Waldo Emerson pronounced it the representative book of the poetry of our age. It drew the attention of critics, but found no favor with the public, for the people suspect and dislike those who nullify venerable laws, and trample upon old forms and usages. Since the publication of his book, Walt Whitman has driven hack in New York, and employed the hours of his literary retiracy in hard work. Some months ago he suddenly flashed upon us in the New York Saturday Press, and created eager dissension among the 'crickets.' Now he is in the Atlantic, with a poem more lawless, measureless, rhymeless and inscrutable than ever.</p><p>No one, even after the fourth or fifth reading, can pretend to say what the 'Bardic Symbols' symbolize. The poet walks by the sea, and addressing the drift, the foam, the billows and the wind, attempts to force from them, by his frantic outcry, the the [sic] true solution of the mystery of Existence, always most heavily and darkly felt in the august ocean presence. All is confusion, waste and sound. It is in vain that you attempt to gather the poet's full meaning from what he says or what he hints. You can only take refuge in occasional passages like this, in which he wildly laments the feebleness and inefficiency of that art which above all others seeks to make the soul visible and audible:</p><p>O, baffled, lost,<br>Bent to the very earth, here preceding what follows,<br>Terrified with myself that I have dared to open my mouth,<br>Aware now, that amid all the blab, whose echoes recoil <br>upon me, I have not once had the least idea who or <br>what I am,<br><em>But that before all my insolent poems the real one still stands <br>untouched, untold, altogether unreached, </em><br>Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory <br>signs and bows,<br>With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I <br>have written or shall write,<br>Striking me with insults till I fall helpless upon the sand.</p><p>If indeed, we were compelled to guess the meaning of the poem, we should say it all lay in the compass of these lines of Tennyson—the saddest and profoundest that ever were written:</p><p>Break, break, break,<br>On thy cold gray stones, O sea!<br>And I would that my tongue could utter<br>The thoughts that arise in me!</p><p>An aspiration of mute words without relevancy, without absolute signification, and full of 'divine despair.'</p><p>We think it has been an error in Whitman to discard forms and laws, for without them the poet diffuses. He may hurry forward with impulses, but he is spent before he reaches the reader's heart through his bewildered understanding. Steam subject, is a mighty force; steam free, is an impalpable vapor, only capable of delicate hues and beauty with the sun upon it.</p><p>But O, poet! there is not a sun in every sky.</p>
